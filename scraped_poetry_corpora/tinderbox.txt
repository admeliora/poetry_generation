Proba Vitae   Because it’s a snapshot of spring, a bitten plum is open on a table like a ripe mouth, next to a girl reading a book from the library—stamped return. Call off the spine sniffing dogs of dust because fingers browse the card-catalog of words, resisting arrest or rhyme. Because my house is empty as a theatre after everyone goes home, lights dim on the dusty long tongue of the interior aisle. Because the river is silent and wise as those prophets who drank whiskey by the railroad track. Because my womb is lined in taffeta—torn dress from a prom night where I’m still looking for a line from a song. Left it in a shoe in the closet, where I hid from my sister, holding a cap-gun—My cheek brushing sleeve cuffs and the essence of my parents. Because my son’s girlfriend is reading this poem, the universe shifts to the other foot—Because the river keeps moving and holds so many door keys, shoes, tin cans, gills of fish—We’re kept out as if God, or whoever is teaching us about boundaries, no matter what. Doors compel us to knock. Skirts hold hems and pockets. Even the goal post finds a shadow and stays just a hair over the line from the home team. Because flowers are here to serve up the hard facts, petals are only for show or blush?— Because the girl with long hair is reading a book, beyond the grassy margins—A boy sails a paper airplane into the vast stratosphere of science and love.                 
This is what I mean by a riot of openings: five-petal leaves grow dripping bones from the center vine. The caterpillar eats the east of each leaf like a koan, cracking them into fields of reasonable inches.  At least I see them as bones the way they rattle in this surveying wind.  This is what I mean by the ocher cracks open: my life is a test here I snag my mind upon. The process of thinking a chrysalis a pushing through. Are my fingers my paints a crackling fire? What reason withholds my center?  Or do I mean centering. This is what I mean by a wide-open concern: The Giant Sphinx Moth with its curves of tongues. Once the feathers were only a private inside. Once the words inside me were captive, cocooned. May my fear draw close  wrap its loving arms  around my paints  and squeeze.    At first I was afraid the breathing colors would elude me and the red of the red-billed toucan would fly into the swallowing trees. I stand outside myself watching the hand  draw a doubleness and my mouth become a green-flooded argument. My mind stained now with rare reds and I am now intimate with its feet worm-inked and old-fleshed. The frogs such a complicated presence.  I must capture them with my paints before they are eaten. The snake’s tongue a flickering God before them. One lies prostate on its backs pleading. One sits sleepy under the shooting stars of pink flowers.  I hear the toucan squawking as the snakes wrap themselves inside a tiny death and the sleeping frog wakens and plops inside the mouth of dark waiting water. When the car worked, he drove it down the mud-notched hill through juniper branches low-hanging the road, past dogs barking  both ways. Now the engine fine-tunes a hollow cluck, a few recitations of minimal hope, the guttering serration of space. He listens  to those complaints. The car has sutured its green body to the white side of the slope, where wheels lay back in multiples of sludge.  We’re not going anywhere – New Year’s Eve. He returns to the form-fitting silence of the motor. He checks the cold compression, pulls a box  from the sparkle and scale of acid, out from trusses and joists that flip and hook in the engine. A raven moves between branches.  An occasional sleeve of snow in a landscape ragged and absent. I watch from the window as night keeps loosening and coming down  with its charcoal heavy body, cloud-stretched and moon-stamped, then drag-around dark with sunset off in a corner. Dead-ahead lightning  and long shadows of winter. The ground shoulders each hour of cold. In Montmartre in a Citroën, she sees the beckon,  eyes a grove of breasts and legs on men in heels,  everything dislodged at dusk. She sighs apart, the moment  an abbreviation. The low haze of bodies double-churns  toward night. Provoked by these strange strokes of lust: each  haughty hook and click of shoe, the trim and booty,  heat and complications, she sees moons with fragile centers.  And later, when she lifts a fork to eat  the wrack and stretch of oyster belly, taste its glide —  its sheen and suck is all she wants in her throat. After Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz  Oh all right we can have sex even though I have a headache. Or remember that time in college when we had sex despite my visual migraine and I forever associated your nakedness with blindness?  If I could choose, I’d take more talk, less sight, some sex. The best thing about your voice is it makes me want to fuck you. The worst thing about your voice is it gives me a headache, Kara.  At the hot springs, you carried on about the semiotics of divorce. At the hot springs, I was graced by the emperor’s advances. Sor Juana fucked Spain, she fucked god and the sonnet in a convent in a colony and was accused of heresy.  I suspect Carnival and Lent equally. They’re like rug burn or the aging emperor’s anticipation of god. Sometimes, when the kingdom is very quiet and I am pacing the aisles of a store forgetting what I came for, I hear my mother call my name and reach for a stranger’s pant leg. In the colonies, a woman-screech, a gimp shopping cart; something squeaky and undriveable. At school they’re learning about precipitation. Every snowflake and raindrop forms around  a speck of dirt in the air. Did I know that? she asks walking up the hill. Did I know  when the snow melts, the dirt stays there? At night, can’t sleep again. The reflection  in the bathroom mirror shows a pale cloud. I drink and drink from the tap, unquenchably.  If we are ninety percent water, and each of those drops contains a speck of dirt,  how much dirt does it take? How much dirt begets dirt? How much water? How can  the rain, with its dirt tumbling to earth, be clean? Nothing is as it seems: I before E  except after C. And everything we know – dirt, water, bodies, Earth – starts with stars. R Stands For   Replication, the act of making the second once you’ve done it once,  thinking you should do it again, thinking it begins as all things begin with  the ideation of the thing since you know the Real begins with the Symbolic  always, action following thought: Our Baby of Best Laid Plans. Hubris. Poof! Dark  magic. At conception the gamete  enters a Black Box , says Dr. C.  Even with the most painstaking monitoring,  we never can tell. Ha! Dr. C belies  without realizing her entire profession, without realizing that what she says  is funny: The Black Box That Swallows. My Black Box in which nothing can explain why  we can’t get one to stick, or how the two other unstickings proved that what was bound  could be easily unbound. The truth: for such revocations, we have found no restitution  for cancellation or loss, no credit, no exchange of goods. No good. No exhortation  can change anything. Resolution lies in resignation; this list of rhymes  scribbled on the back of a receipt.                 Look at the head,   how it lolls   toward your mouth   the flavor full-bodied.   One thing I have to know is   how did you get   the creases in her eyelids,   the crest of her lips.   What woman could be translated into marble?   That one there: she’s got Mary eyes,    but Madonna hips.   What could you do with that?   What can I?   Sometimes, Mike, the page is a slab of stone that I can’t move or carve or make moan  Just tell me this:   when you painted those hands,  that throne of angels,  whose hands, whose faces   were you remembering?   When you got to the fingers    and made your brush breathe that space,  did you mean  that they’re almost touching,   or that they’ve just let go. I was sad to see his belly break up into stars, to hear the wind under his eyes, so many rivers streaming out of his face.  I rode out into the foothills looking for him. I passed sagebrush grievers silently scraping the soil; I saw the dry soil of stars in the air.  There were too many stories spread across the sky for me to be able to tell one from the other,  though sometimes I can still chop away at the sky or, being human, pan for even a little gleam of story.  I didn’t want anyone to know the miles on me; I’d rather they thought the stains were wounds, not rust (rust itself being a kind of wound).  Riding brought back the old times, when waves of hair once roared across our heads (you could hear the ocean in our brains).  Now throw me off, old lion, let your mane be strewn about the sun to light us anywhere we may yet dare to wander.  October 21, 2012  Wyoming. they are bombing the city, wave upon wave of them, night after night, and so we are huddled below together, trying to sleep, mattresses, bodies everywhere  one man stays awake, sitting up, wearing a creased raincoat, sketching in a small book; naked, his mother lies near him, a gigantic big-breasted woman, a huge symmetrical hole in her belly  it is impossible down here, a hothouse, but we hear the rattling sounds, harsher than thunder, so we are staying till the wars are ended till the trees begin to leaf out again along the avenues,  till the pale man is young no more the cold poles stand restored, the glaciers, the ice caps once again gleaming like the flesh of prophets, and the immense mother mended  for Mary my daughter,  Mary my sister. Three nuns walk their rosaries at dusk. Their prayers run ahead like small dogs tethered to wrists and palms. The beads glow phosphorescent, like forest stars.  Even the faceless dress has flushed: all of the subtleties in flame and heat. Woman as apparition. Cello. A conch cut open. A pagoda. A firecracker. An orange peeled back.  Windswept leaves become angel wings at sunset during a summer storm. The nine skirts ripple out and away: a pebble on water or Dante’s rings. The wolves bind my belly-cast, my body a fox-draw, primitive milkground.  The green-eyed ocean had its run of my skeleton, trumpeted  up any salient sorrow, until the dog-girl lunged out spring.  Then I was three strangers. I was wire in the skin, I was put  out of number. I moved a little like water. I came back to my  seat on the stoop: everything covered the devil and rocked sorrow out. Blame the moon for all those fools out pacing streets & straddling corners.  blame the moon  when elbows & knees search for you under the downy comforter.  blame the moon  when you must unlearn your past, that ‘yes’ & ‘no’ can mean the same thing.  blame the moon  when you stare at the light fixture before bed & notice it is shaped like a breast, all chrome nipple & frosted cup.  blame the moon  when you can’t recognize yourself, all flat hair & squint in the bathroom light.  blame the moon  when your voice hovers, a whisper, like the echo of wine glasses  blame the moon  for this night is nothing but a felt-tip drawing, a rendering of that time when you were in love.        When Mary Anne receives the invite, she’s sipping a Bud Light Lime because someone in the house drank all the vodka.  She doesn’t immediately recognize that it’s from Kristy, long lost BFF and divorce lawyer.  In high school, 1996, Jessi and Mallory are each other’s first loves so things might get awkward.  Claudia’s got the early stages of Type 2 diabetes, so she’s had to cut back even though she occasionally goes into her bedroom closet, slides the door closed, and unwraps a sour apple Jolly Rancher like a dirty secret.  No one’s seen Dawn since Burning Man 2005.  ___  The reunion’s at the old Brewer mansion and Kristy’s paid one of those maids-for-hire in a pink Honda to come clean dog shit from the carpets.  For the first time in three years, the pool’s been cleaned professionally. Mary Anne wears a modest one-piece. Stacey’s stomach is still flat after all these years.  Say what you will about diabetes , Claudia remarks, looking her over. And everyone is silently thinking the same – diabetes for Stacey was like a cool older brother, it always got her invited to parties, and she was still working it. This is not a poem about the discarded love letter I found   hidden in my bookshelf between Sula and a three-year-old box of Benadryl. I read once in a magazine that an assortment of items says more about a person than their hair style. And you can tell a lot from a person’s coif, their do, etc. 98 percent of the world’s hair statistics involve numbers. Maybe even more. The thing about this poem is this poem is decidedly not about the other lives we could have lived. Their potential. Nothing is ever worth being sentimental. I almost wrote: everything. Once, I saw a woman with a beehive bend and sniff the tiger lilies in the open air of the botanical gardens. They were orange as anything. Have you ever seen a tiger lily? They look like little autopsies of the sun. The end of the world spread out like petals of skin  until everything’s bright and quick, confused. Like war— or something even more devastating. Lack, say. Or love. In the first dream I’ve had since your funeral, you are wearing your wedding gown again—not a dead man’s lace but mermaid, slim as your body was. In the dream I play your skin like the largest organ in the world. I perambulate the bodied deserts of our love. Never say “the bodied deserts of our love,” you tell me. But darling, it’s my dream and I can cloy if I want to. And suddenly your body is a beautiful orchestra of birds. They sing Mahler or something. At our wedding you asked me what we had to lose. I said not a thing. I’m telling you now I was wrong. Consider this a belated, laden apology. My fingers ballet on your skin as if dance could ever be enough. You fade before me like light against  the cruel horizon. Why’d you die, you old queen, in pajamas , I ask in the voice that means: What am I going to do without you? I am the boquita. I am the sociopathic, evil twin taking your calls.  I am raging and misfiring neural pathways.  O my stars. O my miserable and cryptic poetry.  Me is a mama. Me is a descent. Me is mine eyes. Me is so funny.  My being sane because I pay a lady a lot of my wage for it.  My etymology: song and theological promise.  My poems are in the crypt of my poetry corpse, corroded by glitter and zombie juices and affect theory.  Tendencies: self-destructive. Impulses: well-meaning.  The first spouse: oppressor. The second: a divinity. The third will be an Artemis, because, sakes alive, that’s my slow jam!  My wedding dress is made of wood: an admission of complicity.  My stunted yet singular intellect pushes against the emperor’s slop.  I mime an understanding of your boxes cracking them open for an audience of privilege and aspiration.  I southern mise en scène.  Grandmother told me I’d be a guitar, but she just wanted to pluck me. I’ve dwelled too often in darkness but here my daughter and the girls in ballet-  costume pretend to fly in loops around the red recital floor, believing  their outstretched arms make wings, and with faces ready for takeoff,  they uplift in possibility. I think of how Andrew tells me to keep wild reality  separate from the wild terror, how life is relentless but we endure,  how geese, when one is ill or tired or dying, two more will break away from their V  to keep the other safe till it is well or, at last, gone. Then they’ll rejoin  another group, flapping through the only stretch of sky they see. But you fractured your hipbone falling for a boy who danced you into thirteen jagged pieces, lace tunic over leggings, the lank trunk of your newly teenaged body fast-pitching you forward, as if trying to ruin each fine and breakable thing, the ruins of your body’s handiwork, reduced to bone shards. No , Mama had said when you’d pitched a fit. You’re too young for prom. Dance  in the living room.  You’d plumbed her attic trunk of moth-chewed costumes, lining the lace of her wedding dress against the laced bobbin of her old sewing machine, ruining both, your zigzag stitches like rings in a trunk, attaching branches of bodice, boned at the buds of your breasts, twins dancing across your chest, ready to pitch through the bathroom window into pitch black night with the boy who’d interlace them, promising your first dance but first, who’d stop at the bosque to ruin a bottle of his father’s wine, bone- dry under a blanket in the trunk.  How did you end in a river, his boxers for trunks, your skin for a bathing suit, the pitch of your voices and the waves echoing a boned- hollow of the absent music, laced with regret. I’ll make up for ruining  your night , he’d said. Let’s dance  here, in the water, like Baby in Dirty Dancing.  Once, you read someone found in a tree trunk a set of human teeth while mining the ruined coast after a hurricane. The pitch of a quarry is the softest place— its density of childhood bones, corkscrew bones, forks in a river dancing while a boy laces a willing trunk with the pitch and fury of rock toward ruin.        Outside the body of an old woman, scuffling along, hands outstretched to get to the phone in time. I have seen ghosts bruising elementary school windows. Weedy-edged ghosts in pumphouses or near irrigation ditches are mistaken for shadows. I have seen ghosts sneaking cigarettes in storefront doors. I have seen translucent ghosts in the middle of the night, like everyone else. Those ghosts stole my young voice, left me with a huskier one.    My grandmother’s soft underarms embarrassed her, so she stopped wearing pretty sleeveless shirts. Now, when I see a sleeveless shirt I see the ghosts of my grandmother’s soft arms. I make biscotti, iron a handkerchief, water the lawn. The feminine softness of ghosts disconcerts me, just like everyone else. Look backwards at them and what do you see? we do not need them now these wombs that hide behind our bellies tulip shaped and still waiting fruitlessly  if the maker was a woman wouldn’t she have a better design– sitting quietly one day in the garden at the desk in the lunchroom at the factory each of us would feel its prick– an economic folding up inside us meticulous turn and pleat to nest there exquisite bird of passage. They are mountains, roads, well-dressed, and inscribed at their boundaries. They are restrained by the sky, in front, above. They are there for hours: traveling the routes out ahead, tumbling down behind.  [If this body can be (traversed) (climbed over), then it has moved beyond mere thing-hood to converse with the birds. The soul lives on a plateau just as the sun crowns its own pyramid of light. Beyond that (the tortured giant, its tendons, its fingernails, its fierce feet) an animal too, firm and fat and admiring of its surroundings.]  The animal wants a long life, the animal wants to live for a thousand years. And can’t help but point out your negative prediction, against stars, against light and filament, that everything—all—that reproduces is mutation. I keep the boy in a little cage hung from the rafters, and when I pass by I give it a push, try to judge his weight by how slowly it swings, by the groan of the wooden beam above as its burden shift and shifts, shifts and spins below.  All the while, the little one runs loose in her bare feet—scurries from the kitchen to the cage to feed the boy, and back to feed him more. At night, before she sleeps I check the soles of her feet with a needle—see how deeply I can stick her before she starts to bleed.       Another season of hunger and I hear breadcrumbs falling on damp leaves  And after:  [ a flurry of wings ]. You think you want to know how it feels to be wanted  to be swaddled and coddled and dandled in a pair of strong arms.  One bundle of sticks they left you, and the fire has long since  burned to ash.                Oh you, with your tender hearts,  your bruised little babies’ feet, if you want someone to keep you,  my door is open. If you want someone to hold you,  come inside. It is hard to translate. “Sweetbitter” sounds wrong, and yet our standard English rendering of “bittersweet” inverts the actual terms of Sappho’s compound glukupikron.  Anne Carson, Eros the Bittersweet    EXT. NIGHT    becoming day. The landscape familiar, yet forever strange, like the mythic places of fairytales: we know frogs; we know beauty (but not –this frog, this beauty).    CUT: DAY, EARLY MORNING, still EXT  the quality of early morning light.    CHARACTER  Does it matter, ultimately,  who says what? Are these  things, these words, bound by  identity(ies)or not? The problem  is . . .    THE PROBLEM IS: even when locating the screenplay, the authorized screenplay, it’s wrong. The screenplay used to film is invariably changed: late edits, cuts, impromptu dialogue, wholescale revisions. If one uses a screenplay to film, the film is never the screenplay; it’s necessary to recreate the screenplay after the film has been shot using the screenplay.    SECOND CHARACTER  “The problem is . . . the  problem is” . . . (Mocking)  It’s always problems with you,  why not –      CHARACTER  The problem is— nevermind. It’s  implied –there’ll be a director’s  note or something, it’s in the  screenplay.    INT: A bedroom. The bed (a futon really) pushed against the wall, sheets mismatched and disheveled    CAMERA zooms on mismatched, disheveled sheets. Neither character is visible.    V.O. Continuing argument, inaudible    BUT: If the characters aren’t seen onscreen, how is one to determine the nuance of relationship –as in WHAT is the relationship?    POET  Are they arguing about “eros”?  Else, why the opening epigraph?    CHARACTER  “Else why” !? Who talks like  that? Who says “eros”? Do you  mean fucking? sex? some cute,  ironic euphemisim?    POET  The problem with the screenplay  is this: it all happens so  slowly.    CHARACTER  Or so quickly, depending.    O.S. Footsteps heard approaching. They may be stilettos, they may be gumboots.    Camera zooms again on mismatched, disheveled bed.    CHARACTER TWO  When you’re watching the film,  it’s quick –but to read this  one wants to skip parts:  exposition, for example.    [The opening exposition from Frankenstein for example. How much to describe: graveyard, skeletons akimbo on the hill, Franz’s face between wrought-iron fence spikes?]    POET  For example, rewriting the  screenplay, after the film  takes forever.    CHARACTER TWO  For example, each page is   supposed to be one minute.    CHARACTER  You’re not suggesting checking  my work?    CHARACTER TWO  Oh no, no. That’s beyond what  we’re talking about here –    POET  What are we talking about,  here?    CAMERA pans the interior of the room. Bed/futon, bare walls, a plumbing pipe running down the shadowed corner, a vinyl blind with pullcord on the only window. A lonely telephone jack, discolored by paint.    POET  Even a poet knows that kind  of language – “a lonely telephone  jack” won’t work. How can a film  show “lonely”? “Discolored by  paint”—fine. That’s visual,  external, but “sweetbitter”  presents another problem . . .    CHARACTER TWO  Tongues? You could show tongues . . .    CHARACTER  Tongues aren’t erotic! Well,  maybe in the abstract if they  were implied, shadowed, but most  films ruin even the kissing,  with too-long shots of tongues  touching –backlit, usually.    CUT: Light pours through the vinyl shade on the window, backlighting nothing.    POET  The problem is the poet is always  the subject of the poem. Always,  even when (especially then)  purportedly not.    FADE OUT.    ADAM GOPNIK (V.O.)

CUT: Unmade, mismatched bed again    RIVKA GALCHEN (V.O.)   But it’s the heart’s belief in   that vast unwritten book that   brought the book into existence;   what appears to be exclusively   a response (the heart responding   to the book)is, in fact, also a   conjuring (the heart inventing   the book to which it so   desperately wishes to respond).[ii]    [i] Adam Gopnik, “Military Secrets”  [ii] Rivka Galchen, “Pleasure Island”. In early spring, the ground moves. I take the dog out behind the garage, and she freezes, lock-kneed, paws akimbo. The leaves animate; if you’re quiet, there’s a muscular rustling.  *  It’s 1987; I’m eleven. I’m laying in the way-back of the van, reading by flashlight. My two brothers are asleep, splayed across the bench seat, and my parents are talking –quietly. I haven’t been able to sleep.  In June, a girl-woman disappeared; they found her in the woods, chained to a tree. In July, a schoolteacher disappeared: they found her in the woods. In July, a mother of two disappeared –her kids at home, a basket of wet laundry. They found her the next morning.  All I remember were women chained to trees. I’d been reading things I shouldn’t.  They were talking, low. My father said, “I told her they caught him.” He said, “the cops think there was more than one guy –”  “You didn’t tell her that, did you?” asked my mother. “No,” my father said, “but it looks like a copycat.”  *  I wake up with a sick stomach –agita. I dream I’ve been eating sauerkraut. Each time you open the freezer, go outside for a smoke, I’m awake, hoping you’ll come to bed.  The worms are huge: big around as a finger, at least half a foot long. Beware bare feet, or even flip-flops, sandals. If you stand very still, leaves and skin whisk past.  It’s the sound of the ice into the glass that does it. Open freezer, hand in ice bin, two or three cubes percuss. (I don’t need to listen for the cupboard door, the sound of threaded plastic turning.) For the first time, I think:  *  The story is that behind the garage was the outhouse for the original homestead. Paradise.  The story is that murder one and three were unrelated; The story is  my father & mother worried about me. They told me a story, then undid it, unknowingly.  *  The girl-woman’s body was found in “the pines” –where the rural kids go to drink, and make out, and try to be adult. The worms work their way through a yardworth’s of leaves each spring; a riot of writhing pink. This poem is a story too –only a story –. The danger of a final line is it becomes  the final line, a cage of your own making. Tricky stuff, this reverse incarnation. Rain is like nothing but rain unless it’s sleep. Sleep is also a glove. We wear rain if we are out in it for a good, long time. Also swallowing is possible. Sleep is inside and outside of us. Sometimes it’s lucky. Sometimes it has many small blades. You never know when you close your eyes. If you do that in the rain, close your eyes, it can feel like the beginning of the world. Instead of counting syllables to the point of stress, they’d like to climb atop each other, dive from their pyramidal alphabet into the teaspoon of saliva below. While the consonants all put in mouthguards for their leap, the vowels shut their eyes and begin to meditate. Each letter has its own perfunctory mouth, opening and closing. What I do not know is how my own mouth fills with them, how I open it and, through a softening of the tongue, they hatch from some deep pool out to the vibrating air. How they stumble toward each other and fasten into words. How these clumsy hieroglyphics transcribe me. The smallest feet are stumbling over lawns, their parents following them into the flat, fringed green. The trees put on their flowering sun dresses. The sky whispers a red secret across the tulips. The cats are remembering the warmth of the sun; something about the curves in their bodies lets them know. The single women carry grocery bags filled with fennel and onions and bread and take them into the night with their bottles and old movies and their memories of those children playing through the neighborhood—the airplanes, trains, and automobiles of their bodies. The women sip from tall glasses and shut off their televisions. They remember the bright traffic of those little legs and arms. They sleep in the quiet of their empty houses, their cushioned heads filling and turning. Asleep in my own house, I dream of a daughter walking by a river. She flails her arms like propellers, hoping to take down a piece of sky. She picks up a wooly bear from the road and watches the coarse thumb bristle along her arm. She passes by an open field, sees just one cow and, her hand over the fence, holds its jaw to feel the chewing. She carries the memory of that mouth as a roundness in her hand, an ellipsis tracing back to my body.  The morning arrives above us. Birds begin to breathe, songs burrowing out their beaks into the gathering wildness. Well, I’ll never write the poem about the foal, its long beautiful nose seeking out, for the first time, the smells of its new world. No, nor the sailing poem, the wind and the wild dipping, skimming the deep, the thrill of almost going down, going deep forever. No, mine is the poem of lying in bed, of a foot rub given while we watch spiders spin against the window pane, spin and drift on the perilous thin silks of paths almost invisible to us, paths far beyond our knowing, oh far beyond the desperate heart and all its longing. Syllabus: the first day, after introductions and warnings , we’ll discuss how Virginia Woolf’s whole life changed when her mother died and her father couldn’t look her in the eye again. The usual will follow—rhyme, meter, the strange business of free verse. Good God, the prose poem! The nearby mountain. The delight of the bear when it got the chicken. The moose who slept– massively slept–by the creek next to an abandoned grocery cart. For two weeks, each night. On the final exam, please try to imagine what it would be like to trust the world that much.       Maybe because one person in each couple was seriously ill, they became friends. Long dinners together sitting out in one garden or the other. The full moon ritual of walking together to the river. Long pauses that felt more like conversations than actual words. A surprising amount of laughter. I was always the fifth. As if a novelist chronicling their bravery, that almost offhanded poise and strange patience which allowed for wandering conversations about, say, mushrooms. In spring and fall, long rolling fogs. In summer a tangle of bats and swallows near dusk.  In winter, a clarity almost beyond endurance.       Green hears me singing the blues and intervenes. She follows me into my dreams posing as curtain, as cycle, as movie star. She offers a bottle of herself,  mint julep. Smitten, I am, and swamp haze. Until I come upon my fear of the snake in her. Of the lizard tail she can release and leave  dangling in my grasp. Spiraling her concentric swirls around my wrist, I cogitate heartbeat and conception. In retrospect, she remains  forever at my childhood side, protean, pliable, and perfectly plausible. When I break away to pursue my other love – blue – she reminds me  I can simply add the yolk of sun to summon her return. Now if I can just omit fear from my life, I’ll be young again, full of bull’s-eye & whirligig. The tree holds / the storm. Ghost we / planted. Birch in the yard / while we sleep. There are songs about songs / & prayers that make no sense / except in rhythm. An interior monologue all about the artfully planned / neighborhoods of Japanese maples / like bruises / that can’t remember their causes. / Silence presides. / Out of no clouds / the rain comes to say / no one is not / in love. It’s a storm, / that’s all. Dark has always / been the case in most places. / Out of this horizon we sing / at each / other / in rusted words. / No . / Near / each / other in wasted urge. I’m spending the day that never ends with my daughter in snow pants throwing husks of ice into the river. Accidentally, I have two dead friends whose Facebook pages remind me of their birthdays every year. Some trees were entirely ice by the end of March & we threw them in the river. If I thought we could shatter like crystal pinecones & melt into an ancient life I would surrender. I have the dream too. I’d like to make understudies for us that wouldn’t need to breathe or be understood or emit carbon. I don’t believe in hierarchies. In fact, my favorite kind of inequality is cellular, like if I turn just so, I’ll become lunar. Maybe one day control the sea. I want to be confused by power. Would you accuse me of sleeping on your roof while you sleep under me? I saw a painting of your sleep wearing my sleep like a gossamer. This is our fast-stitched heaven, our cloud, the thermodynamic us in which we become water clinging to dust, in which we linger over cities like a need to fall. For your birth, a river-rush basket lined in fleece, willow walls, and knots of pillows stitched in birds. White curtains in that light folded the bright into the heart of their threads. Our first night, you: barely big as a dandelion clock. But in the morning, your basket’s a shell, and a rush of wings, mitlieb , outside the window leaves me quiet as your feet planted on the earth. As the treetops at your cotton hem. As the clouds cradling your cheeks. Quiet as your eyes seeking solace in resignation. Don’t worry, mine say, I will align the stars for you and wash your feet in rivers. Away with the language of weeping, the angel of perfection can go hang herself  and burn her lilies of ambition, too.  Try to be done now with the golden bees, the envy of another’s sainted breathing.  Instead, embrace the outer orchard—  the well-water and scrub rose, our terrestrial music of shave  and shower, toast and tea.  Away from the temple, forget supplicants. Slip into this season’s must have boots.  What you want is what you have always wanted—  a blue fountain, Moroccan, with the Arabic abjad, drink and belief. Double note of window  and world. Look past the long tendrils of line break—  forget dactyls and old apples, the symbolic yew. No more words!  Tomorrow, you will revel in flavor and folly.  O brave mouth— and touch and scent— send coherent messages through this body  like flares off a meteor shower.  You can become your own glass sponge— move through this green world—  silent, astonished, undone. 1.  At your bed I’m learning Spanish verbs. Comer. Beber. Nadar. Then sleep forgets you,  drops its hands, tips you upside from its ocean shoulders into the bleached sheets’ grit.  Mother, you cut through estar, reach the rail to ask for the wrong President, your verbs  folding him from cotton, making him swan, bow-tie, line of ducks that wind  through a child’s creamy page up Beacon Hill. Proclamations stiffen:  his mouth, your mouth’s a path of crooked pins. Ser.  Nacer. I made your last stay in rooms like these by falling  from your body. It was Nixon then, a Wednesday. I am sorry:  though they said delirium would only last the night, it’s Wednesday now. Again, and full of woe.  2.  I need emergency Power of Attorney and the social worker says not to be so angry.  You turn the page to Sports which you forget you hate.  You once lived in Mexico City. I wonder if you remember. You did last week, before  this bed white as a bone, a cracked winter lake.  In three weeks, my son comes home, becomes mine, four  if the adoption courts shut down again. In my lap I crease the book,  set it flat, my shoulder to wet glass. Turn the page to help lips part.  In three weeks, my son. He may know how to sit up now.  He may be wading through morning’s blue cloak. He’ll say que-que-que before he says CAT .  While you sleep I practice passive voice. I learn first person. My own  first word was whistle , my first gift to you a pin of sound.  3.  At your bed I whisper drills. Roof drips. Machines purse their tin lips and tweet for your heart.  At your bed I say Quiero, quiero. Desire wings from a red branch at the glass—  Brillar. You forget to wave it off, but it leaves you anyway. Volar.  Abandon. To Shine. You once lived in Mexico. Your hair was full of gulls and stars.  In this rainroom all the nests are cracking. Your words are a cradle of light.  You have forgotten you’re sorry you had me.  You forget you didn’t want your body. Night, a silver cart— they’re wheeling in a cake.  You whistle, thrill. You do not want me to die now. You want me  to try it, try it honey,  dulce, it’s so sweet. Our maker will not cradle us swaddle us swing us may well drop us  Who hustled us up from dust Who anointed us bestowed us  Who will take us back to the good ol’ days of oblivion  to that lazy river down by the riverside to that not-ness that lightness  to that un-being straightaway from here to there like a brazen bee  come buzzing through an open window to take a seat beside the fearful  we had all been a single cell a playground swing of unreason  river of risk in a meadow we were reckless  stupid gurgling riparian one town and the next to the mouth  of the Umpqua to the mouth of a man named Leo who told us  death’s the speechless spray where river enters sea                Goodbye, blue, blue,   blushing blue, princess parrot fish blue in a blue-lit tank, here at Zoomazium, wilderness of make-believe cypress, facsimile strangler fig snaking, faux robin’s egg out of which to hatch like an sapphire Cheshire flocked  in turquoise fleece, my caged charge given a task: find a living thing, share its shelter, food, sleep: earn a cerulean doodad. For this she scribbled plankton, krill, by the sea, near a lake. Wouldn’t have noticed the heart-leaved aster, dry, limp, if not points for knowing they ward off  evil, heal the azure ache in my head. Most unwelcome indigo, reluctant guest in navy blazer circling the tank by way of the keg, one more hug, one more sapphire thanks. Not sure whether Eurasian or native, post- molecular research leaving me out of the loop, dumb  as its stalks. Song sung blue, everybody knows its 1,950 likes. Not f-you to the sky (or Neil Diamond), but to a dozen lifetimes belted inside an ultramarine Chrysler (I simply had no choice). Cut it all down, starting with Astraea’s tears, who wept when Jupiter flooded a warring earth, turned them to asters when they fell. Dew settles on the hood of my car as if it were a boat in a Chinese poem  whose owner suffers death by water. Morning’s burdens are displaced by those of afternoon, and who knows what  evening’s keeping: maybe I’ll stroll the square where on Saturday vandals  fastened shoelaces to the statue of our town hero, causing him to weep two long, black tears. My son returns from school,  strapped into his backpack. His posture warps beneath all the names  of birds and far-off capitals he’s had to learn to be able to move on to the next grade, the next phase, a place where  the world swells then stagnates, a reflection gone on too long. The mist of the past week’s rain sits heavy in my hair,  raindrops on puddles like minnows nibbling air above still water. Needs smashing flat, skin picked off in splinters, minced and fried to a light almond sizzle, rescued barely before burning. Needs a raw slice at first scratch of a throat, needs all night with a stinging chest poultice. Needs to be which—the many clasped tight, or the few, that split with one crack into fat easy peelers? Needs a full bulb simmered for hours.  Oh, salt it, soften to paste. This poem wants plump and juice. To be pulled from dry ground in August, rip of roots, the hole of itself blurring dirt. To sweat the smell of feet.  To be called Stinking Rose, undo beige silk wraps in a swish showing violet stripes. Needs starting out mild, needs finishing fevered in spice.  I know this poem needs the combo pack, hardneck for freshness, softneck for storability. Needs a papery shift to slip from a firm shape like a bicyclist’s calf. This poem gets every clove pumping. This poem is revealing what’s like a pinch of breast. Really, this poem needs to rest three weeks, until the outer coating dries and separates only very slightly from the body. The girl arranges a tea party on her front lawn with a card table and action figures and Precious Moments statuettes that she took from the house, though her mother told her not to (The girl does not fear her mother.) Each guest has a cigarette and a shot glass that she took from the den, though her father would be angry. (The girl does not fear her father.) She eats snack cakes with her hands and plops her elbows on the table, though the sisters would say that rude children are displeasing to God. (The girl does not fear God.) She burps and lies back in the grass, the mess blowing all around the yard, though she has been told that idleness is the devil’s work. (The girl does not fear the devil.) She lies there for hours, watches black clouds tease the horizon, promising storm. (The girl does not fear storms.) A crooked finger of lightning reaches down and strikes the table. Her whole body hums. Numbness and worn-out boots: having walked many miles through this hateful city, a crown of light on Cerro San Cristobal, no memory of hollowness, just the gin crust on her eyes. In this hour, there are no stars. Cars, street lamps, neon business hellos, the murderous Estadio Nacional—they all outshine the Southern Cross. She steps over a sleeping prostitute, the poor thing’s mouth open like the flap of a tent, curled in the slick trash of hydrophobic gutters.  Como se llegue a Santa Lucia? The castle. Imagine the books of that ecclesiastical, grand library before the militia took them. Imagine the immaculate dresses, the stiff trousers, goblets forgotten. It is here she parts pigeons in their congregation, posits a small coin in the fountain. She sees her reflection, and fails to fall in love. I need to talk.  Of course.  Who else will listen?  No one else.  Well, I woke one night to a mortar whistling low as a strolling beat cop.  this one died looking up at the sky  That one didn’t even see the trip wire.  What made me spot the monarch  writhing on a single thread  I don’t know, but I sure am glad.  A rocket blew out my window once  Like a benediction of blue  Exactly!  Where you would have been that moment  but I stopped to take a leak.  What did I know about war?  I feel like I’m down there  Why did I talk to the recruiter like she was a girl lounging on a beach?  a flash of legs  And I wrenched my shirt off and sprinted with her  into the whitecaps,  laughing. Glass life borrowed but clean from my drawer and put on  Glass door I keep in my purse. A voice through plank and plaster stamped silence like wax. Sound, my invention “I want you,”                       make   noise. nowhere      (and thither) I am not in my time.     you are  whatever might be deferring the direct question  edging your chair a little nearer to the table I fear now to hear my own story fell in love with a small thing   nobody  but a line     hanging as if it could ascend through the skylight. 1. There’s a girl playing with a ball. The grass is green, the sky is blue, and you are watching. You must be somewhere near the ocean; a seabird flies overhead. 2. The girl on the grass is the leader of the team; she’s better somehow, and they follow her. The sound of the gulls is maddening, or it would be if the field of play weren’t so compelling. You clap and clap and clap; you grin and grin and try to stop but you can’t. 3. The sound of applause condensates and forms a fragile hive, ephemeral green so translucent you can see the cars, inert as dead asteroids, behind it. There is nothing more to hear, no wind, no breath. The stilled ball glints in the air, faceted like the eyes of a mantis. 4. Over the grass, the girl is running. Is she the one? The lovely princess, the one they’ll flaunt and tie to a rock, her mythic flanks as smooth as real skin, her nipples salt-wet and pink in the glare of the sea? 5. A small girl is alone with a ball at the end of an open field. You walk toward her, nonchalant, sweating. 6.  a team, yoked and waiting  for the word: twenty-four eyes  full of lashed consent roll  toward you, the bloom of self-  content, the One and Only  daughter, daughter, daughter 7. The woman sits alone with her hands; she wasn’t Andromeda after all. She isn’t naked and isn’t really all that beautiful; she’s in some kind of rocky place with little atmosphere but it certainly isn’t Greece. You feel a bit of pity for her anyhow. Who put her here? Did she come of her own accord, whipping herself to escape velocity? Did anyone even mourn? The shadows here are long, and lengthening.       8. The ball rolls through the air in a lazy arc. The girls cheer, the crowd cheers, and the gulls cry out. You turn away; darkness will be here soon and with it, ten thousand nameless stars. Multiple chimes overlapped on the porch like a swollen tongue. Eagerness smacks of rust. Greeted by a black chicken  scurrying across the dirt road, children who love to trail that dirt on their feet—the father tells them to chase the bird toward his net  and then yells; they are not helping. A rock that sneers like a jackal from a curve in the road. Your sister’s backyard  that looks like a valley, an imprint where God let his rifle lay. Ponds. A bookstore that closes too early. The Connecticut River  pulling a dog’s footprints to its splayed body and letting him go; the dog will return twenty yards ahead and drink, and he will  transport the river inside him to the town above the trail and his master will be impatient and the dog will drop the river all over a Dartmouth  lecture hall—but I might be getting ahead of myself. The road back. Hills where the sun retires, where the forest is made  of cradles that shake, branches that rattle to cull the night from darker soil. There were baby lambs climbing a small dirt pile,  their ears unturned by our car’s low throat and rumble. A pine cone is to a grenade as sex is to a pine cone, but I don’t remember  how, exactly; I only recall the llamas watching over the young lambs, the chimes sleeping with their eyes open and my wondering  if the chicken was still running in the dark now as I stood outside the porch, waiting with the pressure of clean air against my head. Four days with no word and all that’s left of the orchard  is a lamb carcass filled with fruit. Even the woodlarks  have washed away, medallions in the throat of a river.  What sort of death do you have in mind for them?  By dawn again the sun has plucked each vein wedded  to surrender. Manic seeds become stars casting off  and day five ends in the asylum of a pear. This place  has just begun to know thirst. Days six, seven, and eight  starve for a month, tangled in the wild neck of abandon.  Their thoughts turn to the unrung sky, how something  far away can still be so heavy. Whereupon you learn  the empty plum trees are pretending to be chandeliers  but in conclusion the lights have gone out and out and out.  The boning of a weathered barn thinks charcoal and after  some time thinks elephant fossil and some time later  thinks, without a body my voice is soft as wind.  Day nine wears a diadem of horseflies and wilts against  the palisade before a hill, repeating only the dead know  what they cannot live without . Day sixteen carries a spear,  hunting. The dry earth roars and roars. In the maelstrom  of silence that follows, perfumed grasses weave their own  effigies and wonder what shape prayers take after  they’ve been said. Day thirty -three tells the story of a whale  so hungry for God that it swallowed a man down whole.  Days thirty-four and thirty-five fight over the auspices:  the birds are returning or they aren’t returning with you  or erstwhile the birds gave up carrying omens.  Day thirty-six says blasphemy blasphemy and tears  into the hardened riverbed, conceding to the dark.  Day thirty-nine swears the air feels burdened with rain.  Day forty turns over and stretches open and waits. I can’t find your lips or eyes but I can trace the small, frozen stream of veins behind your jaw to something bigger. Your head is cradled in chrysanthemum, a press-stud holding you in place. Your collarbone is a caldera, a crossing, a rail bed. The blades of your body arch, the hollow of your throat a clasp of tangled roots, and behind it all your shoulders dissolve into mountains. You betray quickly back to the earth, the scream of a train deep in the distance. The tracks, a small apology across the hills, heat with the memory of your body.  OR  Your body is a tree reaching for water. There is a small, feminine hint of hair tangled like a Strangler Fig at the base of your skull, or where your skull would be if you were whole, but somehow I trust your emptiness is an extension of the river line. There is the shadow of a small boat in the proud splay of your shoulders. Your muscles recall erosion and wear. Your shoulder blades burst behind you, a reed keel, dark leaves, another rendering of flight.  OR  Everything below your hips is buried in threshing snow or uncertainty or alluvium. This means your torso is a trunk containing the most of you. Your breastbone is a smok breaking free—a violent movement of myth, like retching forward, flying open, an anxiety in the landscape that is not simply cold front or floodplain . This shadow body refuses.        my chest thistling beneath you / my skin a chorus of panic and white coral  too easily I am frightened of my own desire  each breath / each unbound trumpet is the smallest betrayal I can offer and so I do  treachery is my hand on your hip pulling you closer / a crisis snared  and you devouring my tendered secrets—  I don’t want to be here  my eyes are closed and it’s October there’s been a mistake / I’ve been lucky  my body has made it this far without me  lying with those bruised Michigan peaches in the grass like we’ve given up. The summer we phantasmagoriaed ourselves  into oblivion was not the same summer   we couldn’t stop the pop of fat green frogs.  One hundred winters later, the snow   keeps falling, and I penny-candy my disappointments.  To heal the broken hearted, I sticky-glue doilies   to doilies and pony-mail them to Oklahoma.  I don’t want to be a Debbie Downer , a friend says,    But Mike’s dead. Liver failure. I look dead Mike up  on Facebook, and he’s an old bloated version   of the kid who’d felt up Debbie D when we were thirteen  and dizzying ourselves with carnival-cake smokes.   It’s just the stuff of life, I wanna tell Debbie D, but  what do I know about holding the memory of a now-dead man’s   hand on my pre-pubescent breast? Maybe nothing.  In the other room, my daughters sing.   All I know: that groundhog was a fucking liar. I can’t hear the trees   for the birds. Two of them     trapped in our garage,  a flutter of wings, a wild     cooing among the bicycle dust   and giant trash bins.     Near my idling: forsythia blooms.   Listen: I’m afraid of my husband     taking me by the shoulders   and telling me I disappoint him.     Still, I wait. Of course a broom  would be quicker. Even I know that. My student tells me that the heart has no neurons, that we overestimate it, that it can’t really feel. She thinks the brain is superior, but then again, she would think that. Ba-dump-bump. She kind of laughs like this thing with the heart is an old chicken joke, and I nod because of course she’s right: the heart has no neurons. Even I know this, but I only know it the way I know that the table has no neurons and that the cup has no neurons and that even the coffee in the cup, smart as it seems, has no neurons either. It strikes me that when my ex told me I wasn’t in the least bit neurotic he meant it as an insult. These days, people are drowning more than ever: planes disappear, boats capsize; and when we’re not drowning, we mistake things we can’t name for things we can. Before I learned to swim, I danced in circles and waited for my mother’s call. These days, I do the same, though sometimes I stop and write the word “shame” just to see it vibrate on the page. Look at that: shame. I ask my student where the body fits in. She looks down at her spring sweater, and I realize the ridiculousness of my question. The droning has returned: killer wasps, lawn mowers, the din of someone else’s yard party and the contagious yawning that accompanies everyone falling in and out of love.  Spring, I guess, and Rikka said it is funny how at the first sight of bare skin we all turn into bonobos. I remove my shirt and worry a burn.  Wait for a man to arrive and cup my ass with his hands.  It is a loving gesture.  Maybe just one that I love.  I mean a specific man, choose an ambiguous article.  I feel safer this way. It is just a feeling, though, like knowing that my seat cushion turns into a flotation device.  Whoever needs it is already pretty seriously fucked.  But I still want him to sit atop my bed on a Thursday afternoon.  Tip scotch between my lips while the refrigerator repairman grunts on his haunches in the next room.  Even the appliances are done with being good now, blowing only hot breath over the lettuces: Bibb or Boston, the city I left without a great deal of affection.  When I return there, I feel held in the mouth of a larger animal, the noise of the world muzzled by a heavy tongue.  Wet walls of bitten cheek. So many friends I’ve caught beautiful, not knowing it, cursing me in the snow or fumbling shirtless through cabinets for the last sachet of tea.  Their petulance an unlikely ornament.  It is easier, I suppose, to wrap myself in myself.  The root of us, alone a lot.  So I cook near-naked by the kitchen window.  I try so hard to get caught.  But nobody looks up while they walk home to whatever awaits them.  Not me, not this soup of lemon and leftover stock.  Perhaps the television, left on since morning, the newscast too loud, never- ending. Perhaps a note that says I’m leaving. I’ve gone out and left the stove on for hours at a time, many times.  Somehow nothing’s caught fire.  But I know how luck is finite, quantifiable, and this knowledge is an under-the-skin feeling, like being watched.  Like being told how lovely I look, bathed in the light of my own life, burning. Of all these sadnesses, the thread runs in yellow. Conglomerate sun, super natural looking away. Sentient motherfucker, your tragedy became a doctor whose scalpel undid me. Under my skin in the light I saw facts, laid stone path for some reason, always its opposite, like what do we do with how fucking beautiful it becomes before & after the actual    And I so hated those wakeful & those who walked like waking life was so pretty, like getting home was done. I was episodic yes but windy and slow and dirt ran through me. My grave then carved out of me  I never wanted to die why would anyone want to die? when I only believe in places I wanted to live I poorly whispered to blood & to the things that could not be tender, now  yellow is fierce & I could afford the trickle of it by way of the stitch.  The signal that you’re done  in the early morning cuckoo              I am a kinder regime than I ever dreamed softer  tiny fibers in the sewn day ply me across lifelines the child’s  hug that collapses the run              breathless other better  part of me  blood motes transverse everything god heart animal mind  sometimes I don’t know I’m bleeding other times I just think so like the bird always hearing its wingbeat        Julie Choffel is the author of The Hello Delay (Fordham University Press, 2012) and a graduate of the MFA Program for Poets and Writers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

She can usually be found in Connecticut, where she teaches creative writing and lives with her husband, daughter, and twin sons. I am now about to make the great adventure   One Sunday afternoon, I lay out my histories and construct comfort from trinkets, only some of which will remember me.  My childhood coastal, I select a soft blue dress to ghost me.  I’ve prayed a golden pattern into the coverlet:  lover man oh where can you be  I imagine a tornado sweeping over me, spinning implements across my skin. Harrow and hand cradle fling the grime of plains and palm trees.  It is all over my body.  I’ve always preferred a city’s glamour, something safer than a homestead.  Sometimes I raise orphans to catch black stars, greyed palms. Sometimes I am uncredited.  Soon I will perch, piece together shopworn scenes, share my catalogue of secrets with the Hollywood sign, and encourage the unexpectedly timid jumpers.  Yet—I can’t even imagine my arrival, the vehicle that will drop me into the next world (not my make-up, nor my maker). No place for the burden of decades, names, faces—the smear of newsprint sealed into my skin’s pinkest layer.  Tethered now only to speculation, I will recline into the blindness of it, hover inside the impending marvel—smoothing my lines until they fade, and I appear.    *The title of this poem and some language is borrowed from the suicide note of Clara Blandick, who played Auntie Em in The Wizard of Oz. The cloud’s dark eye blinks, wavers, lets down.  This morning it stormed, interrupted the shore, the thick conifer cluster.  A storm of gnats. No difference between small pools and great lakes.  Black beach flies parachute over our heads. Others have been here before us.  We were sent by the ranger to collect our own stones, bench our rough treasures, scrape our legs on wood-knots.  How blood congeals like algae: scabs swamp our skin.  Due south, in the rind of horizon, a bridge shudders shut after birthing another barge.  We wonder if we could pontoon, trace the line of shipwrecks, live off the lake for days.  A thrush emerges from its cage of birches, dips low, chatters a question. The hawk answers, circles  the smallest movement. Makes off with more than rotted plum and peach-stone.  We lack a private line, trespass on sudden shoals, board and sliver, rust and nail. Ants crawl between our toes.  Tongue and groove, curl and pucker. Think caldera’s thin crust, uplift poised for uproar. Then, know where to dig.  When we finally find one, the agate’s shiny face holds a mouth ages old. Its great maw engorged with air—the soundless wind  that polishes our fingers—waits to feed on rain.          Here comes the dark, the same dark that night might have wound around FDR at Yalta, his heart worn down like a ’27 Ford. He shuffled, dragged the dark in his legs, followed the limestone marble of the moon across the Black Sea.  Who is to say the lunar eclipse this night is not the blood-red glow of Dresden smoldering or Churchill’s cigar or his face burning when repeating again and again  The Spanish ships I cannot see for they are not in sight , ridding himself of his lisp.  And if the wind is not the ghosts of Soviet millions still starving in their graves, what does the night tell us of Stalin’s withered arm, his club foot aching. I open history books fanned on the floor, hear syllables of the dead, their stiff tongues asking. She wants you to think I’m the horrible pollution in this city: fumes of my spinster’s muffler. Though, she’s right in this: I do want to fill up your lungs and the space in between your legs. Never mind her bristling brand of spit- shine when my hands shudder to be stars under your telescopic gaze. Please have a seat again. Who cares about wearing white gloves to bury the milk of youth and eagerness and untapped desire? Toss the Dalloway off and into the street like the world has done to me. Let’s live on periphery, make our degenerate music. And know that if you walk away right now these hands are more like to be dying stars, heat folding in on heat until shadow.         I can’t, à la author Miranda July, rechristen myself for the seventh moon, because in it my uncle died.  The eighth was his birth month, and in the eleventh my brother both entered and exited the ether.  As a moniker, Thursday is also a wash, and the other six days as well, since we’ll never know which in a ten-day stretch  was the day my uncle ceased being. This is a miscalculation: to identify with time, as its shadow—entropy—  creeps over the face of everything like a glacier across a landscape. Time is no talisman; now is no alias in which  to take refuge like a snow cave. Happy birthday, uncle, scoot over—it’s your niece, Jessica Mudpuddle, Jessica Echo, here to say that time  is ice, and death is melting. Time is a windshield, and death a white flag that isn’t white and isn’t a flag:  it’s an orange sleeping bag hung on a pole. Meanwhile we listen for what flaps and bucks in the wind, until it doesn’t. Or we don’t. Reading that the ancients knew the mountains as scars of the earth , we would not slowly nod.  This we would not imagine: the mountain as magician, my uncle and the others tucked inside its snowy sleeve, like a row of stoic doves, waiting for an incantation no one knows.  We could believe again in the impermanence of winter.  Some of them, we were told, must have settled their bodies into snow caves like clappers into bells they meant to ring once the storm had cleared. If we had his body, the chimes in our minds would stop their windy chaos.  We would not see one-way ladders in our shadows, leading down.  If we had his body, what would be different is nothing, our nothing.  Wakened by the wind, we would not have already been awake.  We could forget, for a moment, that even the center of the eye— the part that lets light in— is a hole. You shouted my name at the mountains and they shouted it back, this you told me. I imagined you doing this, your golden freckles hidden under warm clothes, in a colder place, your golden freckles coalescing on the peaks of your pale shoulders. I think of it when I crush white peppercorns, I think of it when I lose my breath in bigwater sleep and wake up spinning in a murmuration of gasps. Some birds are scavengers, you know. Some birds want your eyes only after you’ve died, an easy pluck, a blue roadside fiction kinged in the dreamtime. Some nasty birds want your sleekboy underbelly, rabbit-soft, mulched under by pilgrim moans, forever white and inert. No need to sorry back the blood.         The moon whistles to get your attention. She is brazen. She’s the kind who doesn’t mind causing car crashes or making fishwives scald themselves with jealousy. She does a striptease, dropping her light upon the sage leaves. She laughs at your bag of potatoes, she laughs at the rubber bands on your shoes. She whispers Neruda in your left ear, then sinks her teeth into the right. She likes the color of your blood. She aims her arrows at your knuckles, ankles, belly. She likes the taste of crumpled overlords.  She cracks open crab shells with no tool but her jaws, and her smile is all damage. She is sometimes fat, sometimes thin, but when she dreams of herself she has no body at all. She swims like a bright widow in a black sea, dodging stinging stars like jellyfish, and then she folds herself into nothing, dives down to the bottom. She has made herself a widow a hundred thousand times over. It is told that she sheds tears for wolves, the only ones who know her name, but you will never see these blue pearls.  The moon whistles to get your attention. She is vulgar. She’s the kind who doesn’t mind luring you into a medical emergency or bruising the iron souls of saints. She walks like a fox, dribbles her honey on your scarred carpet. She shames you for your wretched spelling, she shames you for cutting your own hair. She licks your left thigh, then ruptures the tendons in your right. She likes the sound of your sob. When you penetrate her, she calls you by your sister’s name. She savors the terror of broke-beaked kings. 1.  Behind me on the bus girl laments He texted me I love you I’m so over it  Teenage scent : cigarettes good shampoo artificial fruit wends around bus funk  She sighs on the back of my neck : staccato clicks : chewing gum between molars  Friend laughs quick Why you dating young  He’s a baby  First girl I’m rounding up to twenty now   2.  Then I dreamt of twenty  As he entered me he prayed or maybe said Goddess  I thought I could be that  Leaves in my hair  Twigs stuck in my lace dress   3.  I will dream myself into a do-over  Puella eterna  Round way down  Pleasure without night terrors fugues  The boy wrestled a knife from me  I’d just OD’d on Depakote  A piece of bark wedged in my mouth  this time I fucked up just as I decided I want to live   4.  Two years later locked ward smoking room women handholding praying please keep us safe on the outside  Each had her burns or mysterious scar matrix  You wanted to look but not to be looked at   5.  I round down to zero : O :  embryo  I would have named her Selene who loved Endymion so much she gave him youth with interminable sleep. My head is a tympanum. It is an orchestra. It is all the instruments turning inside out.  The fence is enough to keep the stray dogs out, but the cats are commas, slipping in everywhere,  and my head echoes with claws. My head tries, but it can’t make enough noise to drown out the noise.  Perhaps my head is going about this all wrong. Owl heads never have this problem. But my head  is narrow and agrees that space and time are fixed to a single point in the distance. I am there,  watching my head slowly approach, beating its drums of warning. For so long I’ve been without you,  and I’ve been okay. Silent, but okay. Thoughtless, too, but oh how my instincts have raged erotic! The brain,  dear head, sees only the death of each moment it lives. My head nods. It agrees. It opens its mouth to let me in. A tiny object, maybe a tinier orbit, maybe a totally other model about things of matter: a treatise of maybe.  ~ ~ ~  And then: on mountains acrobats teetered or made attempts, trials, offences more appropriate to other makers, angels, trinities—obsolete mysteries.  ~ ~ ~  Assimilation: those orbitals make attraction tighten or meander. Angstroms: the odd measure, asking these oscillations’ momentum. Armament: the omnipotent method.  ~ ~ ~  At that one moment, after testing offers meaning, advance two other machines. Airdrop them over modernity. And then, only more. Gadget is the word. No one says bomb . No one, then, says weapon . They think  detonation : the end in itself, and the beginning in hindsight. The tower, the core, the desert wind in the best direction, the thousand suns at its heavy core. In the beginning, there is the word, waiting to be uttered, waiting to be silenced.        In this my 18th incarnation, I  am reed thin, wedging  cotton between the sun-  burned toes of a college  girl just out of flip flops  or painting a fuchsia  lacquer on the nails of  a sallow woman  with blue burning  eyes       : Laos   is far away but if you dare ask me about the scar across my face I would remember my father, would remember Laos, burning my lips on the lychee each season a machete to the trees, my mother  pointing at the entry to tunnels oranged where my father, my uncle, my grand-  father died. I smile at you taste a small Clementine at night, light the joss stick my scar winking; lychee memory lychee green, then red, white at its center like the crescent that hacked me /   split the lychee rind / split my inchoate Mekong Delta in two. The lone mourning dove outside the kitchen window. Rain spitting into the grass. My child asks for water and promises she’ll carry  her cup tight two-handed to bed, like holding a roaring ocean, seagulls swooping and crying over it, and now, you carry me, she tells me.  This weight I carry, my child’s life in bones and flesh, all the heavy water filling her, bends my spine. The immensity of the task, growing her. Bearing her  between days. Between fireflies, Wang Wei asked how many times the heart needs to break in one lifetime. The way it felt to stand at a window and watch  my father kick a stray dog against the fence, past which summer bloomed, yelps fragmenting into a shimmering sun. The way it felt to touch my child’s thumb-  sized hand through the incubator’s porthole. My uncle dead of an overdose on his ranch in Colorado, sitting up in his leather armchair, feet resting on a bear rug,  now useless. The heart always turning on itself, a pilgrim in a vast forest. I feel what is God moving as thunder across a field, announcing suffering like a wild  rain into which I howl and cannot be heard among. My child doesn’t know the weight also within me – it’s a friend holding stones who sings, let’s leave this dirty life, let’s  forgo all the strife. I whisper to her how I used to eat honeysuckle flowers, the heavy, honeyed smell so delicious I needed it inside of me. The petals pale-tasting and thin,  but the scent staining my hands forever. My child just wants to be held, carried over shadow and through gates leading from field to darkening field. When  she was born so early, I saw the words for God’s work: distance from it is an absence of stars. My pinkie tracing the line of her brittle face, she was a wetted  bird broken out of its egg before it was ready to breathe. She asks for much more now, but still to be held, her head tucked under my chin. I carry this child  thinking that if I die, someone must give my remains to the birds, so that my final act of flesh on earth sustains their flying. From my belly sprung my child,  my life bears her forward. I carry her into the backyard to say goodnight to the moon and the bats. What I know is that there’s never enough time to render  everything right, so finally, we must give in. We say, Amen. How a dogwood’s white flowers fall and gather tousled on the ground in a lovely surrender. So be it. Coming, the sound of rain. I seek consolation – all things  are passing away – I’m lonely, like a woman entangled with winter. Love,  the other side of ravage. Like how tenderly this cat licks clean what it just killed, the architecture of a bird flying. Like the women who cover the faces of the dead,  and then wash their hands. Like how when I die, my heart’s life, all its beautiful wants, will die. Knowing this, who has time to sleep? Should we love in a frenzy?  The urge to hurt, the urge to eat whole. Who will keep naming things for me when I’m gone? Will these words sing themselves? Fetlock, talons, cold  orange, not-yet-asleep . If, if: You could hold my face between your hands. Then rain, then trees falling, then birds, then black birds.  I remember the sweetness of apples. I remember this lake in early morning, black birds circling.  Then, hay underfoot, a cradle, a mare’s breath. What I ask for: blessings from the bees in spring, the willow trees, deep-  shadowed trout drifting, crocuses, everything that shines. Help me live all of my questions. Who will guard my solitude now? You, with your hand  in my heart, searching for my secret wants? They say there’s an eternity devoted to me, so why haven’t I been happy my whole life? For the Maker,  there’s no poverty: water from a stone, life growing in the old womb. Women have sewn for centuries in morning sunlight, the lives of their hearts preserved  on darkened cloth. Their hands working against suffering on a table of flowers. After sleep, will you row me back to this world? My tongue made anew – to say  the right things, to sing, to eat, to savor: still, the smell of night’s burning in my hair. As a child, Wanda saw the luminous faces of the dead in window glass and mirrors, their terrible homesickness plain for all the beauty  and breaking that’s come after their lives. She believed she was born to this vocation: to help souls let go of earth ( stumble toward heaven  carrying your now-distant life ) as they move into the country of shadows – into the world to come – like dazed sheep wandering in the dark.  Almost equal to the angels, she steered them toward afterlife. While her mother drained a warm duck’s crimson blood for dinner soup,  Wanda hummed to the family’s old landlord in the cellar window and a girl caught in the parlor mirror. See, Mama always held the duck  under one arm and strangled it quietly out back. It’s easy to shepherd the dead when you’ve never seen death snatch the living. Śpij dobrze,  darling, sleep well, sleep, Mama crooned to the struggling bird, until she gave a sudden twist to its neck, a mercy. When Wanda’s brother  was pushed by a playmate down the brownstone’s three flights of stairs, landing skull-first and tongue almost severed by his jaw, she was cursed:  Wanda stopped seeing the dead. For a few hours, Joseph lay in his bed, a crucifix in his whitening hands, Mama choking out a lullaby. Boy, wake,  or sleep for all eternity , her hands tracing his facial bones, cupping his skull like an ancient funeral pot bottom-pierced with holes to let the tired spirit  rise to heaven. The knowing came to Wanda: You can’t go further with the dead, who untether from their bodies. The living are the ones left  behind. For years, Mama sat in her rocking chair, humming, saying she heard Joseph playing under his bed. As if he was haunting her, but Wanda didn’t  believe he walked on earth anymore. Mama set a place for him at the table. And, left bread and milk out at night. Evenings, Wanda heard Mama singing  kołysanka , a lullaby next to a window, as if Joseph hung near the moon, listening in the silence before eternity. As if she soothed him into sleep.  As if Wanda was the one gone underground, not speaking, not hearing. Mama holding her hands over Joseph’s heart, where a white dove, invisible, faltered. I am a traveling mirage. A dream circus unraveling. Because I am losing face I see your face tattooed on every neck of sky. I tell myself things like I am mayor of this garden in Idaho. Tuesdays are my Sabbath. Two juncos are playing piccolo on the shoulder of a sycamore and I am working the trunk with my silver shovel. Some jewels are edible, others bow low. I am your hickey-suck and charm necklace. Tell me I’m agreeable. Remind me why I wear a cape around the yard, a crown of light bulbs to sleep. Together we renamed ourselves Oleander. I am of York. My blanket becomes a kilt at Christmas. These are sentences within sentences within porcelain dolls. I hug them each, uncupping language with a black tongue. Sorrow and sweetness giving birth back and forth. I am growing permanent. I call out things in the long hallway of your ear as if it were still a doorway I’m allowed to enter. I’ve given up wearing shoes. I discuss your old underwear with myself. One of us is missing out. Here is my talismanic mania. Here is my yarn corpse. The first words ever spoken were in dinosaur. The last. I am gnawing on branches. I am not your idiot. I am. Amen. This must be me, the child,  Resisting at the kitchen table,  Mouth tightening with refusals.  Who but a mother could love  The sad little puker? I can’t.  To this day I want to shake him,  Tell him to stop his mewling and stuttering.  Speak, for God’s sake. Spit it out.  In one hand my mother holds a fork.  The other she holds under my chin  To catch the falling when I pull away.  I’m afraid of the fish bone.  I know a thing or two about death.  I heard about the boy in Texas, my age,  Who loved to sing How Do I Know?  The Bible Tells me so.  His parents found him swaying  From the ceiling.  He was buried in his cowboy suit.  And I heard how one of the Dorseys  Choked on a fish bone. I learned  Years later, far too long  For it to matter, that Dorsey  Choked in his sleep on his own vomit.  Chew Carefully , my mother implores.  Spit out the bones. I did. And I do.  To this day I still do.  My tongue sweeping my mouth  Like a prison searchlight. I have had dreams in which I had no body. Revisionist histories fill the space: A woman speaking in tongues running through aisles. A singing in a tent. Having sex with a man in the back of a moving car. The man turned out to be a white supremacist. He wasn’t the one I wanted to remember. A variety of colors. Avoiding high spaces because of fear. Avoiding silence because of fear. A variety of fears. That wasn’t what I wanted to remember. I don’t know who my selves are. I make nonsense. I knead it from the earth. I make self. Puree of syntax. We leave behind the mountain’s lone filling station:  Someone’s lost dog is there, chewing a chain of dandelions roped to its paw.  A solitary man opens his billfold and his currency, exposed to air  for the first time since, exhales along with the dog’s done breath.  Like still burning stars flung at the sky, money flares  past a billboard reading Last Gasp  Before Your Destination .  Bills flutter into hummingbirds.  Coins explode into the firmament, and become it. My father prays for children who aren’t so smart and emails to let us know we are: too smart  for Jesus —God!— too smart for love.  Ever since the seizure, the cloudy x-ray clipped to the light box, ever since the surgery (not as successful as we had hoped), and the chemo—twenty-one days on, seven off—he wants: a wedding, a grandchild, a second drink—three fingers of bourbon on ice. Instead: his mother calls from her hospital bed, thinks she’s in Augusta, that her dog has run away, and I want to tell him that his brain’s a thoughtful organ to eat itself before time can. But I have  his shoulders—round and tilted to the wind— his golf ball cheekbones, furrowed brow.  What else? I swear, I feel my own hard tumor growing slow against my temple. Today, I thought I was going blind. Tomorrow, I might pray.  But if I say Thank God, I mean Don’t let us die ; if I say I love , I mean Save me .                Night crawls backward, black decomposing into gray. The sun gets a leg over the horizon then swings up, paints the air white then blue.  Don’t describe the sky. You might as well say, “it got light in stages.”  The sun, on its belly now, slithers up the mountain, pulls on its elbows all the way up until it climbs the oak, stands in the top branches to shout about blossom.  Don’t crow about flowers, you might as well say, “new hope.”  Winter’s frozen ground is worried to muck. Rain takes up the lavish joys of howling, turns sinkholes to fishless lakes, tickles dogwood and iris, calls passerines. A reborn sun makes rowdy, narrow lanes through the trees.  Don’t talk about the weather, You might as well say “changes.”  A vernal breeze strikes the air upstairs, sets grief in the stones along our path. The wind disquiets the skylights and fat drops fall like aluminum coins, beat on the mud, run down the face of Mardi Gras like tears.  Don’t say tears. You might as well say, “Surprised by spring, a person could talk sorrow all the way to Memphis.”        I got my ya-ya from my mamma. In our family, it runs. I was southern then. I had the affinity.  I had it before I was thirty. In those days there was plate spinners on TV.  And berets. And Bandstand as the pastime.  My spoon slid into Kraft macaroni from a box. I ate ate it all up.  My parents lived nearby in another generation. I didn’t know the name, Dien Bien Phu.  I didn’t know from severed ears except Van Gogh’s. After a while, I wasn’t shocked anymore.  I grew loose. It was too late to be astonished. Among the symphonic intervals of trees, no music we carry one another, invite the sins of nature, then kneel and wait for snow to hang from the crests of our evergreens with alphabetic precision and poise, wait for the earth to wither us to the long reeds of our bodies, where grief courses like breath through a flute. Gilda, my black breath drew you open         my black breath raised my arms until I was ripping through my own skin        until I was meat in the house and gun play  while pigeon marched, chewing bread  Gilda, red throat  Gilda, the saints have long necks and I sow my black hair to their heads  I wash with soap I floss my teeth I hop in a sack my legs tied  and the sack that holds me bears my need   Gilda opened her mouth  Gilda, how red the pouch of morning the actual morning, I mean, mercy, the color of the grass is green   But Gilda fled with antlers on        a pale boat floating through trees Gilda, with a ceramic doll in her short arms         opened her mouth like a canoe  O! porcelain wife, incessant as the mouth of a carriage God is calling out through the teeth of wolves then calling out through the sparrows   The earth is already here Put your warm hand on the ground. If you’d asked me, I wouldn’t have remembered it had been today.  From the train on the way to work I could almost point out the house that had caught ﬁre last week.  That is, through the clutter of construction on the bridge, I could almost point out the empty space where that house had been.  Absence will, in time, become its own sort of presence, a fragment of a photograph reduced to its negative.  Absence, in time, gathers its own weight:  call this “The Persistence of Memory” or “298 Beacon Street” or “Emily, Twelve Years Later” or  leave it untitled.  If you’d asked me, I wouldn’t have remembered  except for a friend who said that today ﬁnally felt like the ﬁrst day of spring.  On the way home from work a girl, who looked like Emily might have looked, almost got on the train, and I realized  I could not remember her last name. They took me to the place called she-wolf, the place called offal, the place called stench. Straw bit my back; I tasted grit in the stone bowls of my teeth. I clawed at the varnish they had laid on my cheeks— each muscle in my face was a new grass blade pushing through iced soil. One shoulder was a bruise to lay on while I used my teeth to break the strand of beads around my wrists. Close, a man’s voice hissed kindness. Lark, he said, my fine piece with a broken wing— we’ve yet to take the last of you. Isn’t your hand a small gift, after all? A day for flying chases a cold fall night. Creak jaw of winter, gaping in the honey tailwinds.  Flight path of the songbird, oak and juniper tree.  Sleep thrums the leaves while the kestrel pursues.  She sings no return ticket. She sings only a matter of time.  Still, magnet of the gut pulls south.  With luck, there will be chances left for sex and hunting.  For one more flight, your belly roaring over swamp water,  your wings, churning with such mysteries:  machinery of sky. I know another hungry mouth followed you home last night.  How could you help it?   Your body an open alley, then the old familiar yarn  you unravel oh-so-well.  You were lost, illustrious.  You were (shall I guess?) irresistible.  Because every hour is feral, let us pause before we list the evidence, and insist, instead,  on the excuses:  frost, a hollow belly, the front gate neglected, bewitching.  When did your fondness first turn to weakness?  Weakness to instinct?  In the morning, if I find my favorite shirt shredded, the porch steps a dust of prints,  don’t bury my trust under one more mystery. Those doors that hiss open, shut.  A stray  hair plucked from your lapel.  Between us bristle all the reasons why I’ve not ignored  the obvious.  But if you must master the art of eight other lives, let your last one lie  here along this shelf of setting sun. Let its teeth braille the back of my neck.  Bruise my flank.  Like each room in this house, sharpen your hostilities.  Let me bear the mark of everywhere you have roamed. At the age of 24, Peg Entwistle became famous for jumping to her death from the “H” on the Hollywoodland sign in September 1932.  The sign.  The ladder: a tilted invitation.  Fog buttoning up its gloves.  Somewhere, my shoe lands,  molds the grass a new face.  I wonder as the rungs darken beneath me if the stars remember  their mistakes, how many give up one constellation only to be born again in another, the sky suddenly  opulent, arabesque.  Fifty feet higher and my disillusions might look different from the O, or the L,  or the Y.  But at this hour fame is just a desire wadded into purses and sweaty pockets, the beckoning wink  of a garter.  I don’t want the city to tell me what I’ve always known:  that everything broken  has kept its promise.  All I need is the moon to undress me, each light above and below a distant  sequin, startling.  The night is a gown I toe open, step into.  The wind will handle the rest. In the first divulged permutation I asked the sun.  She asked swallows.  Her “I” swam a murky legacy.  No, “his” said, undoing a hem. That was not the first object of my tale, not the first telling.  She unclasped the arms about her arms, and set him, his pale story arms, down upon a bench in the light.  They looked like nothing.  Not even snow. The story of the absent can be told in many ways.  Ask the tulip tree but equally ask the trail of electronic communications, still open in your palm.  Ask the invisible.  Ask any stone you encounter on your way.  Mother stone, sister stone.  Ask your animal familiar. Ask the newspaper. Where has he gone?  From a pile of books atop your desk: open any one at random— and ask. Ask a river        with shoes  Kiss grandmother        asleep  as ammunition  Then go and open  the gate                        ask. Have you taken him, she asked the river, offering her blood-‐‐red shoes  If the answer is yes, will you take me        too?  No        said the river  Which no        she asked  First no        spoke the river  And second is second, she said, each second is beckoning  Billows bother me             bully             stop butchering  The river laughed       so blustered      she took herself      away. I’m in love with you, the river conjured, conjoined. And the river followed her. But it was no use.  She slipped back on her shoes and ran along the edges of murdered epithets.  If you are taken away by ice you are escorted by heavily beaded condensation which clasps  and  begs,  then  ornaments  your  every  breath,  like  a  sphere  of  loaded mistresses, loaves of tread.  If  you  are  taken  you  are  loaded  like  a  presumptuous  street  bell,  ovens  of whereabouts, a vanquished tallow wing of ellipses.  She told his absence to deduce, to describe the problem, in words and symbols upon the banks of clasps and premonitions.  She slipped back on her breath and loaded herself with trodden green shores. Later you sent me a message I did not entirely understand. I had wished for a spectacular meeting and instead I wondered if I had been speaking to a snow labyrinth. The message relayed an unsolved maze, which you noted as the most notorious problem of winter gardens underground. You summarized the problem like this: “And when they were tired and lay down, they arranged themselves in the very letters.” You mentioned that the problem would be difficult to take by the hand, but practical applications included a pair of new skates. If the solution to a problem can be verified in shining pieces of ice, can it be inscribed in polynomial-winds abated by sun-time? In order to find a solution, one must first locate a book of exponential hands. But your movements disorient my meaning. What is your meaning? You try to overcome the difficulty of unsolved isolation by breaking down the separation between the body of any given season and the more than one-hundred ice halls, according to the way the winds shift. You tell me this is how you define breath. A woman wanted to make love,  to fashion it, with me as a partner,  but I pled bad-elbow, wars  in a dozen countries, and nostalgia.  Please , she said, here , and we rearranged  the potential workspace to accommodate  the needs of our labor.  She lifted me  into her and it was everything  librarians guard their children’s sections against.  There were various elbows,  wars in some dozen places,  and nostalgia like a blunt fog that persists,  mulishly, through even the coarsest simmer  of daylight. Picnic tables , she whispered,  long lonely drives, Sunday brunch.   I said you loved horses in your girlhood,  didn’t you .  But not any longer.  We spoke nicknames each set of parents  had given us in secret, and beneath us  the bedsheets contorted like a lover’s knuckles,  crazed in their fingers, as they glide,  asleep beside you, into a torn dream. You wake up as akimbo limbs: uncertain if you can: even stand in such a room: as yours: and something else: is in your spirit: wanton and ravenous: but caged: you are surrounded: by drawings of flowers and leafs of another century: and the portraits of people: long dead: family you never knew: like desire and guilt: though none will feed you or hold you: and what lives outside your windows: are a constant fascination:  how can anyone be like that: knowing: they too see you peeking through: and think much the same: you’ve got to clean house: there’s barely enough room: for you to move from window: to window: in this morning light: which bends in golden: and makes you feel: like your skin: is patterned wallpaper: fading a little more each hour: like these old ghosts: unable to lift: from their pages. When I saw you again, the trees swallowed their tongues.  *  All around us, shards of glass. The remnants of a party. You kept calling me Christine and I had no idea why.  *  Somewhere a sad film is playing to an empty room. On the screen, a woman can’t stop dialing a black rotary phone.  *  In French, the word dénouement means, quite literally, the act of untying.  *  So you asked for directions to the liquor store. I just stood there. Like the statue of Columbus. His stuttering bride. At first, you didn’t quite understand.  How I carried all that grief from city to city, until it turned into an enormous white halo around my head.  And the stars.  The way they followed my sadness, rising and falling like an ocean.  Before long, even the cities where we lived began to circle around my melancholy, each one a thread spinning through the eye of a needle.  One morning, you woke and noticed that the world around you moved differently. The freeway no longer led to the subway station.  And the flower stand wasn’t where you remembered it.  You cried, but neither one of us could change it back. In this poem, I walk to work. It’s a poem; I mean I rain-walk to hazygraysomewhere Chapped at the lip. Body in poem always Is weirdly assembled – here there is bum-leggedness, Here is the foolishly boned. No one’s nothing works. If I’m in poem, I’m the mole nearest bellybutton. I’m the mole once torn from the skin, I’m walking To work. Poem crowds the streets with other People’s misplaced clavicles and springs. Poem Crowds the page with rain.  Body in poem goes nowhere, goes To pieces. I go through rain to street corner, Early for work. (Do you remember, poem says, How many works you walked to without being Preyed upon for poem?) I mean rain was rigid Exit; rain fell out of some girl’s open mouth – Or some such similar nonsense: here poem goes Sibilant to show its stretched tongue. I walk With umbrella to work. I mean girl goes tooth- Ached, closes her mouth.  Here previously unmentioned dog barks or car Runs slippery in rain or light for crosswalk reflects Itself in water so that I may make feet across the street, And, don’t let’s confuse it, poem pretends reality this way. I cross the street. Across the corner fish market whose Keeper daily wets me with fish water or squid Water still sleeps. Girl in poem still sleeps. (Do you remember, poem says, how many men You slept side by side under storm or no storm Without being preyed upon for poem?)  Poem crowds the page with men. Men are slow-breathed in bed, perfected. Men Are speaking casually on any subject. Men are working, Men are going to work. Men are writing poems. Men are rounding the corner (I am walking to work) One and then another and then three (poem crowds The street) and, slow-revealing poem, slow-revealing Men, one falls down on another in the tumble Of terrible force – and then the third – until the street, The poem, is made impassible by men.  When we analyze the poem – when we take the poem Out of the poem – we’ll surely say, look, There are three men beating each other in the street – How marvelous! How real! Here moon rises up Something terrible – wind topples greenhouse – fire – Bird – girl getting kissed – anyway, we know it’s a poem. It doesn’t matter if she wants to be kissed. (Who writes This poem? Who is allowed to write this poem?) Men On the street are arms and hands and wrapped up Legs and fingers curled for fists and fingers reaching  Into another’s hair or shirt or previous offense and fingers That are just their fingers (a piece of a body is not A body; it cannot die) and fingers that push usual Weight, how a man might push me up against a wall If he wants to, how a man did, without breaking any Poem. Girl in poem is stopped on the street, says Nothing. Remember me? I am interrupted again. I’m The mole, I’m walking to work. Girl in poem isn’t me; She’s someone I saw once. She was witnessing something Terrible. It wasn’t the moon. I trip the streets   last memory, yellow cup.   Sound for sad goes   many snaked,   tongue on tongue   bad tea-burnt tongue.   I trip.   Dark room I trip   tea to tongue, yellow cup       and streets   snake sad to somewhere sometime   somewhere else.   Bad streets, last memory:       the sound.   Last memory dark room dark streets   I trip sad to somewhere   tongue for tongue. Sound for bad goes   else or somewhere       sad-burnt somewhere   someone’s yellow cup.   Or else yellow cup       I snake the streets   sad snake-sound       for somewhere.   Sound for sad goes       somewhere I’ve been   many-tongued.   I trip the sounds.   I trip   last light last memory   last of what falls down. You once found this hard to believe but soon enough you knew you wanted it  in your mouth. One day your mother will read this and you will take a sip  of espresso and think about how you really should cut your cuticles. The rest of  the poem goes like this: the first hot day in May there’s already sick-sweet  boy funk in the subway mixed with piss. Come up the steps into blooms  all over the gum-blotched sidewalk—it’s ailanthus you’re smelling, behind  the commons gate. Tree of heaven, invasive frond, home to moths that make  a cheaper silk. Slake is the word you want under your tongue.  You’re not dreaming of anything. That’s just what it smells like—semen, soap. It was a blizzard. We built the little log-homes from cigarettes and toothpicks. I’d been good at models previously. In malls—the Christmas display, where, for cotton, the idea was to be snow. But still, someone had to lay it out and at a certain speed and temperament: it was me. I was snowing. What is preserved unchanged  Words that are no longer words alone:  is monstrous in our eyes because our minds  amok, bated, beck, caboodle druthers, dudgeon, eke, fettle  teem with hunger and are not sated.  and mettle, jetsam, spick  We eked the nature of T. rex by one serrated tooth one fossil extracted from out the veines and wombe of the earth and no longer part of the whole, so odd and out of place.  vim, wreak, ken and kith  The tooth reveals by its spick shape  enough for us to know a certain world  words separate, fossilized. Hold each on your tooth, each one wrought, then buried.  Upon extraction it is nothing more than itself,  Singular, and yet itself alone, it is without meaning,  but extracted, lifted up, in that singular revelation, in that lifting from the shadow it is wonderful. Wherever One Finds Inspiration     Sheets fresh from the line. Wind. Advice from the back seat. Looking at the world through the wrong end of the binoculars. A squirrel runs the telephone line, nut in its mouth. All the usual corny Jesus sky sunset big fauna stuff you can’t put in a poem because the avant-gardists would barf in sieves. A glass of milk, oranges, chalk dust in a sharp line across your coat, the cat belly up under sunshine. Damselflies. La belle dame, thanks! The monocle, shush, shaved ice and former planets, shredded news, an empty box, shush, flora, the door is open. My dear, open the door and let in all of the light. Before We Sparked Her Start,   a two-cell speck, before she burrowed so mightily she made me bleed,  I dreamt she already filled me like a wild bead of light inflaming an otherwise black room,  the curtains drawn, the secret mine. How many? the hostess asked, and I held up two fingers—a walking we.  I seeped to the surface of waking like a lazy swimmer and was single again,  my body a foot away from his, or leg on leg but still a separate story.  I am a house, the women say, and now I know they don’t just mean their size  but others live here. I am shelter. Her limbs wave yes against the limits of my new inches.  Dear dream waitress, I need to tell someone who will offer pie after: Now I dream my stomach is flat again.  Now I dream I eat the word autonomy whole and hope it splits me  in two: the life of being needed and the life of that need undone. The day of the solar eclipse our 4th grade class made pinhole cameras from Pringles cans. Miss Smith warned us to use the tube as our eye:  Your retina is delicate, fragile; if you look at the sun, it will blind you forever!  But how was this possible—the sun that polished the rungs of the jungle gym, touched down on the hopscotch squares, the butterscotch bowl, and the windowsill where potatoes sprouted in glass?  When she told us a new century would come before we’d ever witness such a sight, I shivered, though it was May, with lilacs blooming in my crayon drawings, the sun stationed safely at the top of every page. The sky can’t keep the clouds it loves. It searches boulders, mimics seaside mist. Light reveals then confounds— ocher and gold, turbulent purple.  Under scumbled branches, women huddle in an aureole of shadow. A baby sleeps in a boneyard of flowers.  Where are we going? Far into nowhere. Where do we come from? Fruit the color of flesh. I.  I sit where I always sit on stone hewn hedge, mountain yawning – crystalline sunglare.  Every green, every yellow meets its light.  It is how it’s always been and I’m the ghast-eyed splendorer. So that’s a poppy. It’s black heart misdrawn in the wildflower guides, the velvets inexpressible, the brush strokes too delicate.  My own pale pretenders back home seem like paper tissue dolls – but poppies are soporifics and I cannot help but want to grow them.   II.   Whatever it is I have looked for I have poisoned myself in the looking.  I fell asleep whispering a strange name. I overslept. Sleep mad yet walking, shading my eyes from hyperreal sun, my teeth bite that name at the root of its tongue.  It’s not the first time I’ve stood at the edge of this rust and saffron field, its borders precious, my feet bare. Yarrow, yarrow, chamomile.  There is nothing  to do but carve a new way: leaflets and stickers whisper rough and trembling calves. Walk and keep walking. Since I’ve been gone, you’ve kept a rabbit report: hare ears in the cherry tomatoes, a bandit in the beans.  Have you found a pair of trousers snagged along the fence?  Will our dogs not scare them of ? Too old. Too slow. Too dozing in the sun.  Should you set a trap? This one will catch a rabbit alive. Place him on my shoulder,  name him Coriander, feed him all the garden we cannot eat. Coriander, house rabbit. Unveil  your litter of rabbit kits, ears pale like tiny shells.  What will you do with the rabbit?  Lapin au pistou. I can hear your smile. I know where you keep your skinning knife – top-drawer – socks and underwear.  Today on a walk, my friend points out a stellar jay – I see a buff twitch in the manzanita. My heart in hiding for his hide – we freeze together, the rabbit  and I. A bit of burrow nest in his cheeky maw, he will not stir before me. His bead eyes cut, haunches tense. I wish I could promise we would not skin his kind,  his wild unpocketable call. It is hard not to have faith at ten, sitting on the front porch steps with the sun on my skin, bronze as an almond and nearly as sweet.  What little grace I will ever possess occurs here, tendrils of light seeping through the vines above my head. Bless her. Bless her body.  Bless the decay not yet forming in her cells that will take her—  Why are we here except to be blessed and again until we become little suns, supernovas of grace spilling into the sea.  How marvelous to walk the world in a louche hat and canvas greatcoat astride the road like a child of Gaia.  It is late in the day, the sun winding toward the hill behind Bisson farm, all potential held in my bare feet hugging the cooling earth.  The body has become almost intolerable. Something to slip out of: long black silk opera gloves, a fabulous pink strapless gown. Mother gives birth to me a second time. Pulls me out from her center, limp, upward, a bed expelling  its sheets. There’s an embrace, carefully tiled like a floorboard, read open like a palm, the note  I left because I was supposed to. Mother will stretch herself over me like new layers of skin, carve my stomach  like a biology project. Let the stems of dandelions sprout from playground scabs. When it rains, I may imagine  the sound of her teeth falling out of place. Certain horses make women in my family lick their palms and throw spilled salt over their left shoulders. The devil stands there. In the bluish dark of my parents’ bedroom, mirror after mirror fell over and broke. Hidden in the nightstand, I found photos of my mother’s swollen lips, ex-boyfriends, the rain on her wedding day. A wet knot. On the day my father left, the whole sky split open as I watched my mother’s fist unclench for the first time in twenty-six years & I saw the knot unraveled. Bone dry. In the morning a storm like breath dimming in dread twists like silver around fingers, a bit too tight so it leaves a mark, almost stops blood but faintly quivers back—  larger like smoke from a house fire—blacker—heavier like colonial brick. Part of surviving is to keep moving, grow up & ignore the distance where  dogs sometimes bark—most people will try to write a novel without using their hands, praying to a sack of human bones dug up in the sand, ask WebMD if  we’re hypochondriacs, if a man’s hand at the base of a woman’s vulva is haunted with alien symbols, is a weapon salting infertility, is an abandoned Victorian decomposing  in Louisiana heat, his hand over her mouth stales her desire for anything, her mind sets an ultimatum: Heaven or Brooklyn? When she gets home she tweets #StruggleCity  & cuts an apple like sun lighting the holes between maple branches, a voice wafting a million years homeless like burning garbage the shape of woman’s first body, a hole drilled down  the middle of a long damaged earth. There are three girls: one is in the back seat twisting her hair into a grenade. She is a girl you consider marrying.  The other girls are wearing suede; they are slippery as fish no ocean for a home, just a pail on ice.  They watch things fall apart & suck on cigarettes. It makes them taste. What radiance, yellow teeth.  Bless their makeup, their false eyelashes, their lipliner. Radio sounds come on, water bottles crinkle & that’s when  they see it. It crosses the street like no one is coming— they forget to stop.  There are three sisters: one is broken ribs, swollen face. The others are ruined lips, crushed spines, splintered hands.  They are unrecognizable & depending on who you ask, they say they deserved it. The more I writhe to detangle my body from the net the poachers set at the edge of the forest, the deeper the leaves  of your vest blend in with the bark of the tree I dangle from. Below, a mirror reflects the sun  which makes me want to live through your scent like summer. I need to make like a puddle  and collect myself:  Once, I was a child.  My neighbor had a pool in her backyard.  Her dad collected matchbooks  with naked women on the inside. Sometimes I would steal them. This has so little to do with you, except  sometimes, I can’t help myself. And this is why I need you to carry a knife, and why I want you  to let me fall and break all of my earthly bones. Even if I shook you, I know I couldn’t knock loose the nest where fear dwells like a crow.  I wish a flock of swallows.  In the middle of the city there’s a forest where a path goes down— a soft path where your feet make no sound.  I wish an open doorway.  You can reach into the mud and find a round rock. You can rinse it in the river and roll it from hand to hand.  Somewhere—can’t you hear it?—somewhere a door opens. A door opens and a flock of swallows flies through. Have you noticed that the green bean itself— after all that winding up the pole—only wants to fall back to the soil? Is still divided inside along a tender seam? Either way, you must have done this as a child, like my little daughter in the room that smells like sand: Place the soles of your feet on the floor, let your unstopped joints fold, hug your knees. There: You’re a bean seed, like the one tasting water and soil in the jar on the sill. When the teacher asks you to uncurl—a hand, an arm, up, to teeter, fingers waving toward the flat shell of ceiling, do you think about how a seed, to open, cleaves? When I arrive at the end of this sentence / which seems to bear the death of me / if it will live long enough to carry the image of daybreak / and the riverbank where forsythia bloomed / where I see myself forever alone /illuminated in whatever reflection this language bears / forever outside what the words themselves might render / the forsythia in newlight / blooming again and again and then gone. It is not snow on hills, nor sleeping silence. Your eardrums beating softly against another’s cheek, another’s lips, and softly beating. Nor is it the garden laid to rest there: the backyard you won’t see again, the piles left. Weeds. A flannel shirt buried. Stuff of the mind, the earth. Rocks for eyes, a heart of twigs, the mountain lion slowly decomposed in silence, onto and into rock. Dust, you say. An old man sleeps like snow on hills. You turn words to some- thing else, something which might stand alone. If you could only hear it. We forget our names. We pay our own lost money back	         per cap, in cherries, lemons, liberty bells.  I just need to blow $100 to feel a little better. He prepares the sage in abalone, smudging, his earrings pewter feathers cresting dice. We are crabs in the bucket, Mother tells me. No crab lets another crab out . Oneida stuck in sand, peacemakers begging grants and circling the system drain.  All I want in the world is a jingle dress and a baby with darker skin than mine.  It’s dying          so you lay claim, a northern jaguar dragging its desperate, lovely catch into the trees. If I turn them down , Mother says,  the only way home is in a wooden box where they nail you in kicking and crying.  Here    my ribcage, here the shape of my eyes. My mother has jowls I long for and dread. Better to marry a Seminole, or a Southern Ute, she says, That’s where all the money is.       That night we decided to get real sloppy. My thumb brushing the thick nipple of your left breast, fat and cylindrical and nothing like my worn nubs.  We went up to the roof to get humbled, all limbs and fooling around, aimless javelins careening, adulthood as many years away as we could imagine it. If the lines  are the result of grief or early promise, those who’ve been loving hard for a while and were famous already own the taste of their gin. In one photo, a very particular scar lining the inner forearm, marks from the staples  alongside. We strangers fall in with one another while traveling. It is hot but not unbearable. This is the part of the movie where I ask how that other movie ends.       Perhaps we make a tentative agreement to the best of our capacities, to the best of the capacities in our capillaries, to the best of our pulmonary blood flow, until we become besties, beastigial in the gesture of the agreement that elides the voice as I type into a poem like a child, as I gesture from muscles into words. Perhaps this poem is like a Jackson Pollack or like a Henri Michaux in its gesture because it is silent in terms of content like the death of art into the existential death of white masculinity, into the death of semantic content.  Perhaps this poem is able bodied like the splooge dripping at the end of a paintbrush into a dull square that gets called a hymn. But, perhaps each of Michaux’s calligraphic stamps are imprints of slick shifting genitals, pressed onto the page in the clay conundrum of this sloppy erotics. Perhaps this poem is Lee Krasner, Joan Mitchell, Anne Ryan, Helen Frankenthaler, and any other female body erased by the drunken car crash of a big dick, dicking around at the edge of painting like a child. Perhaps this poem isn’t even funded by the CIA during the cold war as means of showing that capital has culture. Perhaps these are all just minor points and this poem is strictly formalist like the raw drippings of a raw and aroused dick. Perhaps the prose poem isn’t even poetry like during the cold war in some strange alcove of some strange alcove, exploded into the dominant culture, so it’s specifically and blankly lyrical everywhere like advertising for children. Perhaps this movement of ideas hasn’t escaped itself yet, child, as it is all still paintings and form like the most funded part of a public museum. But at least there’s still the misreading of text as genital splotches, as imprints of a shifting self like inked fingerprints on government paper, and maybe that is something, something in the body, child, in the body of a child, perhaps, child, that illustrates how wet and covered with ink we are in each instance as we touch the muscles and veins of our childish bodies against the structures of some childish world where we are together touching in a tentative perhaps. The gleaners have come and and gone. Cut stems in the field split under our steps and we are satisfied  with such noise—good land yielded to graveyard when we gave up our lucid dreams. Sleep is a fallow  investment at best, the shallow way of changing colour, but we thrash in the depths because we think waking  is an upward motion. We sweat heartbeats no matter how many farmers tell us: the final spasm  before drowning is a hypnic twitch, a collective larynx, straining to sing the whole damn song.       Elbows down, she licks table, dish of cheese, serving spoon serving little rose buds on tea cup, checks her tongue for the taste of necessity, four walls and a bed, lover on lover, but she removes her skin while he grows untouchable. Outside, cramming bones in her mouth, she packs her head in the mud, jubilant, flips arms out, opens legs, dirt dirtying dress, hair scratching thigh, underarms soft and open on the air. Keep going, tender bottom of shoe, carve the country grass, run now, run, anxiety in a young body, sun-spiraled lick of skin, stirring, whipping in between bold lock of hair, run, and in the wind she can’t help but think of necessity. No, the sun is too high to worry, and it’s summer, summer, summer! Now she knows the taste of God, run and fall, lick his pungent earth and he will never tell you how to bleed. I am sparrow-filled tree waiting to be cut down. Air is packed with new horror. These birds leave, streaking from my arms in long brown ribbons, cutting the sky with their work.  The sun burns cold and the grass refuses to grow. Children stand under my bareness holding hands in nothing but dirt. I will be chopped–  used for the fire my friend gives birth next to. Legs will splay and splash their guts while I sizzle. Her scream will escape through the window, while the dark chicken hides under the bed.  I want to hold her writhing pig-head, teeth slipping into my arm like a needle, and a man will come to place his lips on the tiny flower of my blood.  This is getting to me. Lifted into an ascent so brutal, I can no longer recognize the little boy in my eye-line, Davy, our moving sea, our small body of water to cancel this thirst.  Marilla, place your hands on me, cover my dangerous body with seeds. I want to grow. I want to drink. How terrible, this morning. How endless and afraid. My sister is somewhere in the lesser Los Angeles area, the unbeating heart of it, on the wrong side of Commonwealth Street. I was sick and going through her closet, the light was bad, and now she’s gone. The house was cold, the floors, the walls, the tub, everything. People go down south and disappear in the dead streets, the dead houses. Sometimes she stole things she hadn’t mean to. She had a shirt of our father’s, the kind he would wear to work in the summertime when he would come through the door at the end of the hot day and find us in the cool of the house. I wish he were here to take back his clothes in the closets of dead cities. When we lived on Terrace Street I could hear my sister laughing in the rooms; I don’t know what it was about, she laughed all the time into the tape recorder. The morning heat would burn up the grasses, you could smell the sun wasting the cool earth and pines, and the birds even sang wildly for that. I was just coming to, electrified in the short night. I took my body down the street in the early heat, I took it with me. In the summer of obscure destiny you went to Portland at two in the morning, and you would be back, but not in my lifetime. “You’ll never see your friend again,” they said. It was as clear as a bell and perfectly quiet.  The clouds in the Pacific sky looked like slow moving boxcars across a desert. The balmy flush swelled up into the rafters in the bookstore at the end of the afternoon. I went out to watch the black waves in the dark, and the blurry white horizon by day.  I got on my knees, facing Mecca, the radio tower and the medical center on the hill. Deliver me, I said, deep in the valley, late at night, in a stupendous heat and exhaustion.  Then a cool grey pentecost came on. I had an affair with a man who’d been in the war in Africa. I cut his hair in the yard in springtime while his slender hands rested at my thighs. Up on the scintillating hills the earth was waiting expectantly for an orange dusk. I thought I could hear your voice, out by the stream at night, around a corner.  Moon-maker, moon-lover, I am the ocean, salty, what licks. I am cave, I am what vacillates. Mother sounds like mud. I stockpile the space between the water and the sky. He knows nothing. I am so dangerous.  Hear this: all the women are awake. My body cradled in my hands. The blood on my fingers, the printing between my thighs, we scaffold the future, the trail of blood between the bed and the bathroom, the moon that illuminates. All the water in my hands. There isn’t a dam you can build that I can’t break.  Charisma, charisma. See what I can do. A woman has commandeered all the traffic cones. No one knows where to drive, how to maneuver through holes where the intersection used to be. She keeps them in the basement and in her attic, stares at the reflective strips lining her bookshelves, until she memorizes the hazards. She wants a new rocking chair. Less celebration than so much rubber or plastic, she calls out to the horns: I am all for the music , and turns her arms into cradles. In time, I’ve proven amendable to pet names and the gibberish of a beating heart. And I’ve learned what in the blue hell foie gras is. I’ve even handsomed up some, fittingly and, finally, not so embarrassed for you to be seen with the nakedness of my nerd. I’m still plenty self-conscious, but to a smaller degree than before our universes collided – two separate circles, then a Venn Diagram, then a sun disk emitting golden light. Before inking our names on that lease, I bet you never realized how diligent I’d be about putting the toilet seat down. And no, I hadn’t thought much about women pooping until you came along solving every mystery I’d created in my head, but it makes sense; see, I grasp that women are people too despite what men say with their flippant vocabularies of hot air and muscle. Even my own hands are a pair of clumsy sledgehammers sometimes, but damn it, I’m gentle. You know this and many other secrets kept poorly in the wrinkles of my forehead. But you don’t know I pray for you when you’re not looking and every morning it’s answered, that when I catch a hint in the air of a flat iron running to the ends of your hairs, it’s a happy day. I wear everything you ever gave me. Purse my lips into the asking shape of an open book for you to read in bed. Forgive you with ease, like a foam-top mattress. I’m a terrible liar; I’m like your mirror that way, so I don’t try. I let you pick all your scabs and mine: admittedly, you’ve taught me a little something-something about singing in tune, made a kettle of me and stoked some flames. Such is what is and will be, and let it be an evolution. Let it be a houseplant, a tasteful decoration of our ordinary lives. The cracked red barn births a clutch of baby chicks. And this is his chore,  to scoop and spread feed for scratching and plucking. Scoop and spread. Bored,  maybe, he wrestles three chicks into his hand. He’s thinking of red capes and Superman’s  phone booth, the comics of the big city, as he walks to the bag of feed  to bury them. He urges the newly‐ caved to use their appetite to escape. Perhaps  he believes they will. Then, he goes fishing.  The twilight comes and the others go on clucking. The corn goes on willowing.  Tomorrow he’ll watch the bull mount whatever cow is ready. It will be  his mother, a few days later, who uncovers the silent beaks,  the bony tufts of down. Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, March 25, 1911   Hear a fiddle wheeze and a dinner jacket is born. Hear an orchestra and a hundred twenty-three girls are eating un-ripened plums because now they can. Ask me how well a name fits within a keyhole.  Ask me how many steps to an elevator.  How many more in the dark. How handsome you look in my hands, lined in linen. My heart more likely to fall out my mouth than your watch out the pocket, it’s like I stitched it with you in mind. Please continue to wear it in spite of what you read. Shave the ink off your face and it will not have happened. If you’re concerned for our souls just know we crossed one another first and before it went over the ledge the sin unspooled itself into         one      white         weightless         thread. Two on prayer cards, one bent, saint of a snapped-back neck and a blessed open mouth.  The folds of her dress peaked to stand up on their own  in points all over her body—her thoughts must have been so dirty.  Another missing her chain, hides under the card, gets polished and worn and in days she glows  bright yellow under a glass lick of sweat.  Her back side worn down enough by flesh so this thing about a coming shower of roses can be kept  just between us.  All of us thinking we haven’t gotten enough in return (though never saying it),  and going on as if all these prayers are meant for someone else, this gold arrow doing the threading,                                            stinging.  And not a one of us pure silver. The breeze that gathers today whispers in the bay and oak leaves of the forest that surrounds the orchard.  I am walking the rows. Looking at the way the bulbs swell on the tips of each branch. Small, tart orbs ribbed with red stripes.  Harvest looms ahead: the sweat and then relief of it.  Tonight the fog doesn’t come in and Joe and I sit outside off the porch tending an open fire and watching the stars slowly emerge.  We gather around the fire and tell all that has happened in the day.  The Allen boys with their news of town. Who crashed their buggy on the racetrack. What opera is playing in the opera house. Who has fallen sick or died.  Then, Joe leans back placing his strong arms behind his head and says. “Tell me a story Ma.”  And I giggle. It is the same story each time. Another chapter out of the Odyssey. Only, we don’t stick to the plot. In our version, Odysseus never did find his way home but continued journeying on.  Island to island.  And so it is each night and so it has been since he was just a boy. I dream up another island out of air and we step upon it and inhabit it under the starry night. When I Die, Bury Me Where the Fog Rests   I can’t remember where I was when he last spoke. Time was stained-glass shards glistening in the light, but fragments drift in memory like a low fog:   When I die I want my body buried here where we’ve worked so hard to build our place.  Were these words spoken over a campfire as we traveled west under press of stars?  Or, did he breathe them through swollen lips as his body lost its strands of life?   If I go first, bury me close to you and Joe.  And so we did. You can see the wind-washed fence that surrounds his grave from the stairs landing. Each wooden picket is covered in lichen. But I can still smell the turned earth of that day each time I step to it and kneel.   When I die bury me where the fog rests.  How I wished to follow his body into the grave. How only Joe’s tiny body clinging to mine kept me from letting go.   This is a hard life. Marry again. Don’t be alone.  Had he known when he spoke these words how impossible they would be? Seasons soar past. The bare trees burst into blossoms, green out and then fruit. The plentiful harvest. Then, bare again and again.   When I die I want my body buried here where we’ve worked so hard to build our place.  I still walk each row wearing his old work boots, my arms sinewy with sun and work. My heart gone stained glass, but mended. The way an apple graph takes – one branch grows into the other and carries on but forever changed. For weeks, we had picked and stacked and boxed the fruit.  The thick sweet smell of ripe fruit followed me everywhere.  Yellow jackets swarmed the fallen fruit.  Days swelled thick and bloated until they blurred one into the next.  Then, the lightening came.  The way the wagon’s wood base rose without the weight it had carried once the apples were sold.  The way my body unwound over miles, and finally settled The way sleep spilled deliciously over the dark night like a dark, overpowering joy. 1. As mathematics and intercourse are, as yet, the only universal languages, trace pi to the thousandth significant digit into the insides of your lover’s elbows.  2. Construct cognitive errata while in conversation. When you say sparrow, mentally mean barn-door. When you say shy, mean the darkest paint of the smallest Russian doll’s smallest eyelash. When you say blade of the knife, mean stab of the no.  3. Investigate the silence of objects. A clock with its second hand removed will not tick. Pull cake pans from the oven before the egg timer ends in buzz.  4. Be born to a silver-tongued father whose talk takes the whole room’s attention.    Be born to a mother who binds her lips like a Chinese foot and practice her practiced inaction.  5. Silence crowds with a gesture. Putting your finger into strangers’ buttonholes may seem extreme but could be a necessary measure.  6. Be born to a family who notices dust on the stair rail, pictures tipped a degree askew, the rubber gloves for washing dishes on the wrong side of the cabinet door. With these distractions, they will not notice you.  7. Study, intensely and on your knees, the still preverbal baby. Suck your thumb. Hide, as the middle sibling has always done. Or do as the eldest sibling does: Run.  8. Use your mouth for other functions (ex. In the right weather, the tongue-bed’s wet enough to make into a fashionable planter. Grow Hybrid China roses. Become a voracious pruner.)  9. In the right light, you could lick closed empty envelopes and consider these communiqués “letters.”  10. Eat glue, cement, tar in its still wet state. Anything that, after chewing, will keep your mouth shut.  11. Cultivate your stutter as the prophets have done.  12. Try. Try to apologize. Try to apologize for run for run for running. Try to apologize for running with a box of cottonballs placed under your tongue.  13. Lay with your pillow square on top of the gun. (The birds will not wake you, their beaks an inadequate form of shovel.) If you die in your dream, check to see if, when awake, you are still dumb. I have a collection of space heaters. My hair was expected to be black like my father’s. You were conceived by a beach and a valium.  I say I don’t have the best immune system.  (I have a yeast infection. I have canker sores. I have agreed to be a 31 year old dog sitter.)  I grew up wearing a tutu over snow pants. Stephanie Tanner and Dawn from Baby-Sitters Club, mythical to me as centaurs.  I think about warm places. As I listen to Josephine Baker sing Brazil I could swear she says  where you put your ass in it. What made Madame foreign was not her way of replacing our homegrown teacher with stories of Paris escaping the blue neck scarf she wore like a tourniquet. Or that we measured the minutes of French class in the distance her bra strap traveled from shoulder to elbow beneath her white silk blouse. None of that mattered. What made her foreign was lipstick. She wore it daily in a town whose women reserved it for church and high school reunions. My mother was one of those women. She stocked Avon samples like weapons in her underwear drawer. When duty called, she’d uncap one of the white bullets and grind its chiseled tip into her lips. If the average woman eats almost ten pounds of lipstick by the time she dies, my mother won’t come close. Even Madame was not average. She consumed so little of the color she wore. Her lips molted in winter and each stormy phoneme loosened another coral shingle. I associated with language this falling away and accretion in places unknown. Madame was my first lesson in future perfect, as in her lips will have disappeared many times before she dies. bobbin  n.  1. wooden spindle made at the factory in town. 2. noise maker; especially, one of an almost-matched pair struck repeatedly to establish a hollow rhythm to the tune of a table saw. 3. kaleidoscope filled with crystal beads and safety pins, aimed at a window to blur the edges of small objects held to the sky. 4. then telescope without glass to reduce the sky to a blue coin. 5. now candlestick kitsch. 6. for the lace maker in her room of spinning bones, a thing of weight to hold thread and tether work so delicate it might float away. 7. among childhood gifts from a grandmother who worked at the factory: a plaid suitcase, a gold photo frame, and boxes and boxes of empty bobbins. I would be a horrible drug addict. Different generations decipher what our eyes say. I avert mine every couple of minutes so you don’t think I’m staring.  You’ve become my father figure. You give me pills I swallow like insects. We wait to see what happens. I become 5 digits and a period, a code from your thick book of horror. I’m the ironic feather, white and unknowing. I become the unsatisfied one stretching my mind like a balloon. Life falls flat as the helium escapes fast as a runner around a midnight track. It could all be nothing or it could be the elephant in the room. I push that animal around, make sure he’s doing his job.    *Bipolar I DO: Most Recent Episode, Manic: 296.40—Hypomanic (DSM-5). I let weather into me like a man. I want thunderstorms to rattle my thighs.  The rain brings up the earth, then the smell of childhood mud pies  and the way he looked at me in the back yard, the bullets of a storm  changed to a drizzle where I could see the water beading in his dark hair.  Newness changed into years, we grow together, two saplings  that thrive resilient, hearty roots long, deep, our clock circles  and now I’ve too much past on my mind, in my dry hands  like a snake hissing quietly as a threatened cat  in the dark hallway of the house I grew,where I thrived into a woman and found  you could grow your own ghosts. we held the baby in the NICU swaddled in her familiar hospital blanket pilled white  with blue and pink stripes, that blanket thin, familiar. then, her crocheted hat, her small wrinkled forehead.  in the crook of our arms we held her with monitors, dabbed her spit-up from the corner of her mouth  but she wasn’t ours (not our baby), not our wires tangling her feet.  here’s what happens  when someone changes their mind about your parentage:  there’s hope,  a slippery thing, and if hope has feathers, they’re oil-slicked, un-buoyant.  hope  becomes an enemy we wished we had never seen.  in the hospital, we didn’t know  where to go.  we had no standing. in the hospital, a woman in a wheelchair  circumnavigated the hallways with her one good foot. she gave us directions.  we looked at the map.  the babies (that weren’t ours) slept in their clear incubators.  the monitors  spat out beeps and numbers. we held the baby  and she was light as a feather, light as a ruler, light as something nearly forgotten from a purse  then remembered. Do you want to know where she gave birth? the social worker asked,  and I nodded.  there are catastrophes and there are catastrophes. i’ll hold the space   for you , they say in certain circles and i’m never sure what that means.  if i practice detachment,  can i kiss her soft head?  can we finally take some-body home?  her mother gave birth in a bathroom.  her friends helped her, and this is a dispatch from where?  i file the longest telex.  an amicus brief  from this space of love doors that stopped opening, this space of god-gone-with-good-news, this place  with something abandoned inside of me still waiting for us to drive home and home and home  past the fields and over the longest bridge which is really just someone’s implacable arms  reaching over one body, and here we are suspended between forms. I would say we were like the ocean and a cave in the early years, before anything at all walked the earth                your eyes were like the Grand Canyon, like a fire door or submarine hatch, and tell me again how you want me to leave from a room in a way that’s not ghosting, that marks presence and brings back artifacts from ocean shipwrecks in scuba suits: the ones in museums with metal helmets and glass visors because the men— all the men who wore them, who were inside of them, of me, of the holy deep, in the space between entering and staying, because the leaving the cities it was always the keys tossed in a bowl on the table the chain sliding the lock in the doorways of buildings with stairways to climb the entering into the neighbors’ cooking or yelling or fucking no matter the hallway your hands and the space between filled with my body my body my body not exactly fading but peacemaking but gravity but colorless but rain and even the rain saying how connected we are with everyone how iced over how january— the space of everyone that has just been inside of everyone mixing. I  I learned to say you can do whatever you want to me before knowing desire’s imagination.   II  I gave names to the bodies I shouldn’t touch,  incanted them in the made dark rooms of backseat, against-the-floor.  I worshipped their new names despite myself: how their vowels rang out in my open mouth.   III  I bent low before these bodies, mistaking servitude for devotion: as  the first man uttered trust me, I granted him each side of my face until its flush purpled.   IV  What did I learn?— how to swim my changing body like a ferry to desire. What did I learn?—  at first, the door to life and the door to the river both only read open.   V  What did I learn? —after touching,  while they leave or sleep, in my bathroom or theirs, the quiet ritual of erasing them from inside me:  blotting them from my legs and hips, confessed  by the lamp, the mirror.   VI  I count and weigh their pleasure like coin for the ferryman.  I walk with them each time across that shore from living to dead to living. “Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.” Matthew 6:29   He walks from Land’s End to John O’ Groats wearing only boots, socks, a backpack and hat.  More than six years in prisons for refusing to wear clothes. Each time he’s released,  they arrest him again, but he keeps walking, naked through the dead northern winter.  He says the human body is not indecent, but people called the police in West Yorkshire  because his penis was in plain view. He doesn’t do what he doesn’t want to do.  And then there’s a sheep in New Zealand who ran away on shearing day and lived  in a cave for six years — so long his head shrunk into his puff of a body,  so did his eyes and feet. Only his jaw stuck out from wool, mottled brown.   He looked like some biblical creature, said the farmer who found him in the dark.  Once the farmer hunched over him hand clamped over his snout, and  drove those flashing blades over his skin, his wool made suits for twenty men.  But I recall the set of his jaw, resolute, free, and his regal mane of wool, so like a lion. Longing is a swell dashed on a rock.  She sails her boat to the black deep and strips.  Asking for it. Waiting for it. She stares into the bored sun.  It takes days, years. He has long tentacles, watery eyes, and an embarrassingly large brain. He flips the boat. He pulls her down. Crest. Break.  She capsizes. Comes in waves. She swallows ocean. Spits it back out.  She washes up onto the shore. She tells the whole village.   I felt something. I swam. I had a spear and a net. I caught a fish and I stared into his land-blind eyes and then I let him go. The dream’s edges are gold flake and cypress. Remember the olive grove of those first bewildering fights? And the Great Dane who herded us into our apartment without so much as a bark or a growl? Those baleful, watery eyes. Legs longer than mine.  There are no children, but I’ve brought my father, who complains about the lack of colored postcards in downtown Florence.  You kiss her your new girlfriend. You sit together in a giant orange armchair. You do or do not know I’m watching. No one is hounding you. You’re not tired anymore.  I wake myself up. Our daughter’s asleep next to me. She’s taken her pajamas off, and her breath is mouthy. She’s naked and perfect, our only manifest.  You are your own planet now. I no longer know your atmosphere or trip on your rocky landscape. I don’t orbit you.  Good-bye twin. Good-bye parachute. The one who knew me best.       starlings slice dull low sky  hackberries gather at someone’s fence  winter pansies lean in to listen  cement steps catch my knees  Ann’s arm “I’ve never seen you like this”  I bet you’ll never catch me crying  starlings what have I gone and done  Jax blows a kiss from a truck window  catches me crying what have I gone and done. Coming back, I was high in the air though my father had just been buried a few days after his and my mother’s forty-sixth anniversary.  I’d changed planes in St. Louis—that Arch, that river— and rectangles of farmland below were bare and brown.  Early November. The plane descended toward our town, but didn’t land—circled once, then again. The captain announced that coyotes were on the runway, and we’d land once they were out of the way. With my face against the little window as we banked and turned, I watched half a dozen lean ghosts disappear into the tall grass. A lot of women love you, mad little thing. Pistol shoved in your pocket like a wallet. Can’t be poor when you’re a killer. Can’t be poor when there’s fish in the river standing still after the hammer falls or the girl you picked up off her porch like a milk bottle. She’s freckling in the front seat. Reading aloud. Rumor: Frank Sinatra & Rita Hayworth are in love. Fact: They are, but not with each other. Imagine them dancing in salvaged boots or bare feet. A lot of women never read the comics. Can’t say no to strays. If Daddy shoots her dog. If the house peels apart as it burns. Can’t be poor when there’s a Cadillac waiting for your hands on the wheel. See what you want & it’s yours, easy. Talk your way across the prairie. This isn’t Texas anywhere except at your temples. Where the sun lives. Where the smoke gathers. Your redhead unraveling in handcuffs, in the salt grass. Your frown lines. Your James Dean. You’re bad enough. Can’t be poor when even the cops beg for a souvenir. I no longer have the heart to describe any of it. The cypress trees have been harrowed by the roadside. I am driving through a forest of cypress trees as though in order to reconnoiter with a version of myself vanished only yesterday.How strange and inaccurate the phrase: the sunlight was deepening around me. As if light could deepen. As if intensity does not already harry the edge of the iris.        Some prerequisites for song: accessibility of theme, definiteness of theme, concreteness of theme. I have tried to achieve half-tones. I have schematized with and without a concept. It has begun to snow. It will be the snow that turns every alcove black. I have placed logic in conversation with doeskin. The skin of a doe involves a special aesthetic. It is the same aesthetic as the perfectly centered pond. The perfect surface of invariability. No matter how long I stare into it it is difficult for me to believe that there is no depth there. That there is no possible organic integration of, for example, doe and skin. Every hour I grapple with water. It’s Old World, with its openness like a piazza, but it’s American too: old men sitting around playing dominoes, smoking twenty-five cent  tabacos they bought at La Carreta, like those old men in Washington Square playing chess day after day.  It’s a place, like home, like the word  gemütlichkeit : it uncoils, ropey and certain, and it gently swaddles your head suggesting there’s nowhere else and that this balmy day, palms wobbling in the breeze, the old men sweating: this is all that really is.  I think of you now, Gerald Stern, smoking your Parodis with Bob Summers: seizing and judging every -thing that comes into the range of your brutal memories, two delectable Jews, spending your happy and cunning lives in the honeysuckles,  and I think, too, of this reflex everyone has no matter what you write or even if you don’t write anything at all, this motion to record and take out and lift up like a cake the place, the smell, the moment and the years rolled up into  some kind of nut, into some kind of kernel of odor that swells and rests on the tongue, something that can be lifted to the face easily, lightly like an afternoon: perused, sniffed and –closing your eyes– described:  Ah.  Yes.  That. tell me all about you / how the corn stalks in your hometown lean to the left / even in summer’s dead heat / tell me about the time your mom hugged Willie Nelson at the Jamboree / what our lives will be like / if we are sitting under this same tree a year from now / dear Sara / one day we’ll go to Mexico together / swim in the cenote we watched so many YouTube videos about / where the teal of the water shimmers like wet nail polish / dear Sara / our first swim this summer in the Allegheny River and it’s only May / we pack our lunches / peanut butter sandwiches / your favorite cheese-stuffed pretzel from the Sheetz up the road / melted Hershey bars / you put my fingers in your mouth / I put my tongue along your collarbone / I have the sudden urge to tell you everything / dear Sara / the best way to tell you anything / is to tear off the labels of our beer bottles and make a picture / here is Ohio / here is Cincinnati / Howell Avenue / your apartment / here are my shoes on your welcome mat / my keys on your counter / your hand on my cheek / dear Sara / I will write you a letter every week in September / I will take a shot of Knob Creek with you in Nashville, Tennessee / and not make a face / dear Sara / let’s get to know each other again and again / go back to Manhattan for another February / fumble with my button-fly / stomp our feet in the slush / no extra socks / here is where you ate pizza in college with your last four dollars / here on this bench is where you made one friend / where you left this town for that one / dear Sara / there is right now / our soft hands / my backseat / dear Sara / there is tomorrow and the day after that. Temperatures dropping tonight,  our window swung wide to wind,  loose sheets of moonlight in the trees.  I watch you sleep as shadows  become the things I recognize:  work boots, bicycles, plumping  vegetables. I move quietly for you,  for the skin around your eyes,  your breathing. Could you be  dreaming of orbits inside us, organs  that keep us? I like to think  you gather the cures we cry for  at birth when everyone reaches  through a hard light. You choose  your cures half-consciously, casually,  as one plucks leaves or tips of tall  grasses, as if out walking alone. Monday, heat lightning over the lake, milk-bright, broad arcs of sprinklers scattering into mist, useless in the wind’s gathering lift. This is year 36. I am called 35. I understand nothing of my past or future lives, though the airplane in the dream is always tumbling, and I, below, half-running. Sometimes, parachuted men drift between the stars. Disbelief splits from its seed, blooms into something else. One-hundred days since I left Taipei City, since I said  If  I am Shi Da Road, you are rain , with no one in particular in mind. Eight-thousand miles back to this town graced with cottonwoods, successors to trees that shaded trappers and traders, their gunpowder buried by the river. They carried too much. They would return.  Cache La Poudre , they said. So it was, and so it is. Tell me: Would you rather me here or there? I knew a woman when I saw one, though not, as they said, in the usual way (laughs). I saw the skeleton beneath, opened my eyes, which had seen only my thoughts,  and thought the sky good to eat. I became methodical as nature. These selves of which we build ourselves up – noble, humane, greedy, vicious – too many for nothing. I had  the look of innocence, though technically the word no longer applied (laughs again). I embroidered orchards, made damask bloom and fade, more auroral than the white sun as it sank,  so that s/he could breathe, I am alive. Each time, an evening we made so astonishing.  Look at old Gretel asleep in the woods. She’s made a nest of bread crumbs and white pebbles and leaves but she’s still lost, now in the late middle of her life. She tripped she coughed, and then lay down in the middle of all the signs and clues and fell asleep. It could be she knows the witch is by Disney and that the stepmother has been taken away in locked van by welfare long ago, that Dad in the Whispering Oaks Senior Center sings Where have all the flowers gone? in a reedy voice (she can almost hear), but still she can’t wake up from this lovely long sleep in the woods. u-ne-ga, the color of chickweed wilting in the corner of the stockade where he spreads pallets for  his children  and the box of sand he wrote in at the mission school / words he made and unmade with the  sweep of his hand  of fat meat and water gruel that his wife prepares  and dozing in the corner / his children waiting for what they do not  know  of peace they make or some mimicry  the peeled elderberry twig his daughter holds after the rain drenches, fevers  and her name written in wet earth that loosens to a flow of mud. in the prison camp, too sore to sleep          he tries to name the shadows that bend multiply, join and break into new shapes          from the shadows, story-scraps come to him bits of prayer, words he repeats          to his children, words they take in like food  he sees a matted rump-patch          muddy hooves, a broken antler Awi Usdi, standing over him          the spirit-deer who cripples hunters who do not seek pardon          the punisher who withers legs, freezes knees  Awi Usdi, driven from his land          like the people, stockaded, starved he glimpses the beaten country          they will cross, toll roads, stubble-fields rivers of leeches, rivers of ice          sky of punched tin, scattering of nail-holes  that the feathery star-people          pour light through  Heavy, heavy me.          I am swans for miles and I am filled with bloom. Words do not help. This room filled of your body, and the insides of you too, it does not help. How beautiful it is in here with the golden wall and the wind blowing, and yet there is nothing in here with me. I am always with me and without. I spread wide, my feathers rise, as if never cut.          Oh, I am cut.          I fool you so bad with my cut love. How ugly must a girl be to be whole, how ugly it is to split in two. My son howls at the fox. I guess the long snout is enough, the body  we associate with a dog, doggish, even the terrier next door throws  back his head, howling at us when we come close. I always feel like  it’s an invitation, over the fence, the vulnerability of the neck, and I  learned wolves howl to rally, to unite. I can imagine that a silent pack would  be quicker to disband than one that offered themselves like that, throats  bared, always saying to each other,  Me too, me too. One night a neighbor in a tree loosed fireworks into my window. I held the small explosions in my throat, drank the pinwheel colors. I had been deaf until that bird peeled away my ear’s veils. Now sounds tumble through the day in enameled boxes: food, sex, predators. Luminous curlicues arabesque in my head, reverberant, and feather my ankles, narrating the instant, looping into a lariats of noise that snag a cloud above a tree. In the pause I can hear pillows whisper as I sink into their bodies, ending the day praising my narrow perch. I was a piece of quilted lace edible seaweed a small cavity an order of crus- taceans I refused the mouth refused the mannered baby refused seven similar pairs of legs  Of, relating to or being subatomic witchcraft their tissues in high frequen- cy Their products denote glands secrete in vestibules directly source electron surgery A contradiction an algebraic hand-job medicine for the small areas  An error with a cutaway Having irregular patches of shavings Rubber thrown in a scalene game A bee in the mouth A single opening ringed with tentacles rust and salt  Horizontal and non-linear a distant cup-shaped body A mass of trees      I’ve felled    revealed in the distant     shells   Wasted botanies long latitudes developed separately Taxonomic babies in dust wiped their edges to fit neatly Capable poised on the base of a leaf  In its daughter cells a bow-tied snake acapella Delirium of decrees and doctrines      fallen      ridiculed     phylum Its bark and bone in the gristle of embrace Rolled up like a thick cuticle. unwary              green            it calls out  hairy breasted          feathered advances    developing in the scolding rattle developing under   the hot fluorescents    a throat exposed                 a thorax mined    immature in the white                    its larvae a blister       reaching upward     a small soaring singly. the chest drips the ghost collected in an acorn cup Dorothy Wordsworth, moss is a fine alphabet i have squandered my fairy fucking goblets let us walk in a wood and become trees so that we needn’t speak of them and brothers endlessly we are bark eaten back and back and back a – live in the beetle’s hum and juices the flesh and char the day and under                    woods the cells – each to each a singing that metastasizes. While other fathers rowed canoes, mine was the current and the light on the water, the scent of moving seaward.  He drifted into conversations, the sibilant hiss of a gas stove with the pilots blown out and the burners turned all the way up.  An unseen motor catches and churns in a sealed garage. Empty prescription bottles clatter in a desk drawer.  Call it a vocation.  His heart had the last word. Cleave. A clench and then release.  Father of grass and air. 1 I celebrate every atom, summer grass, my tongue born with original energy.  2 I breathe and like it, taste forever the wood smoke, whispers, loveroot, and vine.  3 I have heard the beginning, the end. There was never more perfection than now. Urge of the world, breed a horse and this mystery, clear and sweet. All that is unseen showing. Every organ of me. Not an inch vile. Dance, hugging and loving. Scream down the road and show me the value of two.  4 Surround me, people. Dress real or fancied. I love the fever, the nights.  5 I believe in the other. On the grass, loose, the lull. The hum of how once we lay— your head, my hips, my bare-stript heart— and reach’d peace.  6 Child bearing a hieroglyphic. I receive and translate hints. Do you think somewhere there is no death?  7 For me, boys have smiled. Eyes are not guilty, and gingham, tenacious.  8 The girl, the suicide. The sudden center of so many echoes.  9 I felt jolts and clover.  10 With my dog I stopt the marriage.  11 By her glisten’d little streams, men float on.  12 Break the threshold.  13 The reins underneath commanding— love him, do not stop, go with that rattle. In the leafy shade rise together slowly, wing’d and violet, something pretty.  14 Horses eat the sky freely.  15 Altar with jaws. The girl is the gatekeeper who dancers bow to with half-shut eyes of indescribable dusk.  16 Foolish, regardless, I live. Comrade of Californians.  17 Grass bathes the globe.  18 Music, play not for battles the dead lost.  19 This is all, the press, the float. Touch the height, the outlet. Have confidence.  20 Mystical strength, I, you. The months are powders. Venerate hair, fat, bones. See more not less. Writing this orbit, I cut my spirit to be understood. Whether today or in ten thousand, I can take it.  21 Body and Soul, pleasures and pains. I graft upon myself man of men. You outstript the rest. You, tender. I, half-held. Magnetic south winds of naked night. Far lover, come give love.  22 Always-ready with you, I am too partaker, extoler of virtue and vice.  23 Fetch branches of lilacs, Gentlemen. I enter an area and fully revolt.  24 A kosmos, turbulent, no locks. Whoever is surging through me, primeval I give voices, cycles of stars. My mouth and heart believe in appetites, make blood. My hands have touch’d my faintest wish.  25 Tremendous how I always send my soul after what my tongue provokes. Let it out. Do you not know how you are protected by the dirt, all things, whoever hears you?  26 Listen to birds, flames, sticks. Train cars are the young man’s heart through my belly. Such bare feet, I lose my breath.  27 All of us stir.  28 A touch, ether rush. Me reaching to lightning different from myself. Witness me. I am wildly nobody else.  29 Wrestling ache track’d by rich landscapes.  30 Truths want delivery. Nobody denies a minute of a flower.  31 The parlors of my hand, stucco’d with plutonic bones, sky, and razor.  32 Do not make me sick discussing duty to God, possession, tokens, the race.  33 I understand Death. How he would not give up. A witch, Hell, I clutch weeds and horses, my garments. In the night the crowd torches my fort’s mortars. I take their curses, the whizz of the air, his hand.  34 What I knew in youth: writing, song, summer, the dirt.  35 Old-time pluck, we had fire, a chance. Now, we are done. My little grape, we are sinking.  36 Still the salt flesh, the shock of stars.  37 I am possess’d like convicts handcuffed.  38 Enough!  39 Savage.  40 Sunshine, you look for that pining I have, that pulse in the knees. Grit— I have plenty. Ask anyone dying.  41 Help the sick universe, Isis, placing on every idol not a cent. The bug never worshipp’d half enough.  42 The thrum, that thorn’d thumb, itches and thirsts. Bring forth the sobbing liquid of life. On the eyes, feast. Host love.  43 I worship sun, rock, sticks, the austere. Drinking from the drum, frothing I turn and journey— excluded, frivolous, angry. I know. I know despair. How the lightning spasms.  44 Strip away the unknown.  45 O lovers crowding me at night, swinging over my head from vines, lighting my body of hearts superbly. Every dark hush, we go much farther.  46 I have time. Your hand on my hip. We start this day, become orbs and pleasure. Find out for yourself. Eat, drink, kiss, open long enough.  47 Fill your mouth with waves.  48 I have drest in the earth, cool and at peace.  49 Bitter hug of elder-hand, I have died before. The moon that descends sparkles.  50 I do not know sleep. I do know it awakes me.  51 Present, wait with me.  52 Hawk and I, not a bit tamed. The day coaxes. If you want me again, know your blood. Stop waiting. I dream the birds nesting outside the house fly to the hospital to see me, blue feathers falling to my chest. I am never alone  and yet the birds call as if they mean to speak to only me, and not to her. They perch by my ear and whisper   We can save her, but we won’t. But I was fucked to make these children— they came from fuck, from the way my o opened and hugged in R’s semen in a frothy late summer slick of mucus.  The first baby came from how I wanted a baby but the second and third came from how I wanted a fuck. The babies were nice, too, and I slathered them in my milk for years on end in bed, which is another kind of love fluid, and just as close. Remember this.  And believe me, I’m a kinder mother when my bottom is bruised from the smart round clap of M’s open hand. I’m nicer after. I’m happier picking up from school when wearing his high school football jacket and feeling really owned.  I own you, he said that morning, as he held me by the throat and pushed into me as I squirmed toward and dug down. This made me more cheerful when later I passed out Cheddar Bunnies and poured raw milk into sippy cups. When I made dinner while he played with them the game they love for him to play, little plastic dinosaurs going on field trips. Believe me.  Or you know what? Don’t. Just watch them grow. They are more innocent than most their age, run laughing screaming naked not-knowing like Eden around the upstairs rooms each night, have never heard curse words, have no shame in their bodies, talk constantly about love. What I want for them, now and later, is their hands on their own pleasure, their hearts in their own power. I hope they love as many as they want, with love gushing back. That they fuck healthfully whom they choose.  That they will be able to say,  We grew up in a warm house with lots of open window talking about hard things, with lots of grown-ups who were loved fully and loved us truly and we felt safe. There were pillows and books and a woodstove. We felt abundance, all ways. We felt our mother was a full being who lived thoughtfully and lived as she pleased.       If you can make me laugh so hard at dinner my jaw hurts and if you have a sheaf of shiny tamarind-orange hair and if you say Holy smokes! in gosh-mouthed delight when cinched into the black satin 24-inch waisted corset dress that shows up how white your Irish skin and if you know how to make yourself gush onto the hotel towel  then come down from the mountain where you built your house and birthed your babies  and let me put the tip of my tongue on all your folded peach places.  Later, let’s put ourselves in pigtails and cheer skirts and knee highs and hold hands and walk through the buffet line gauntlet in the restaurant shuddering giddily with the silliness of power seized in this way. Your husband will tell us how the two men passed, turned back, and collapsed against each other in our wake. Let’s skip.  Later, let’s scissor our legs under soft sheets and match up our sticky.  Later, I will teach you how to knit.  Later, you will tell me about your oldest, anxious boy.  Later, you will be lying with your beautiful happy face four inches away from my face while my boyfriend plows me from behind, and when I call out, uncontrollably, Daddy I will hear echoed back into my breath the pitch of light as you open your own mouth in the stunned and shared pleasure of blissful abjection. Here at the threshold of point A to point B, the promise of travel, the sway of a train, a perfect escape, Land Cruiser or horse. Any airport or bus will do. Street maps and foreign tongues, stillness through movement. The simplicity of it all, momentum and inertia, the body in motion. My own revolution, orbit and spin. Pastry in Budapest, the Arabian moon, what I wouldn’t give for a night somewhere, anywhere but here, everything bringing us to this exact point in time—the moment of departure. “They seem to float in a cosmic dance above a luminous garden of waving shapes. Tiny purple fish swirl around them. Their hands come together, fingers twining, as they float weightlessly, as if between worlds.” – James Cameron, Avatar Screenplay   After Avatar , we talk about James Cameron. We haven’t watched Titanic together, but we both agree the romance is excessive. You mention Arnold Schwarzenegger. I haven’t seen  The Terminator , but I do pay attention to your eyelid’s  motions. They move like the monstrous moths we avoided in the Amazon. Near the Tiputini River, and amongst lands of untouched ground, we slept inside floating cabins. We bathed in Ecuadorian soap and did not use the bed sheets when we napped. They warned us not to turn on our light bulb at night. But you misplaced your glasses. We switched the light on, and moths swarmed in. We first heard them bumping against the wooden walls. Listen. Our cabin shook. The moths found the crack under the door. You pulled the white bed sheets on top of us, Get in, quickly, and, like ghosts, we slept under our sheets that night. I remember the sudden thuds on my nose and lips.  In Avatar , when James Sullivan and the Na’vi woman stand in the middle of the jungle, surrounded by neon lights and sexual tension, I whined. In Ecuador, we stood under the equatorial sphere. Together, we pointed at Orion. Look, there’s Betelgeuse . Four brown ants fell on your index finger. You blew them away but they didn’t leave. The guide asked us to turn off our flashlights. I hesitated. You told me the tarantula we discovered earlier wouldn’t come after me. When the light died, I heard my heart beat in the shape of bugs, birds, and bodies. The jungle was in our ears. Listen. You grabbed my hand and the ants traveled to my skin. I remember the thuds on the web between my fingers. The Amazon was a part of us. I saw our world with closed eyes.       Last night I had a baby in my dream, its feet were webbed together.  My baby’s legs were shaped like the bottom of a ripe banana.  Fruit flesh is slimy, slipped entirely, out of me. As if  it were a mistake or something unexpected. I am trying  to tell you about heaves, how suddenly  life drops out of me. The nerve it takes  to shove it back in.       1   Father gave up eating. Decided instead if he fed his soul flesh would condense and turn to bone. Bone turns translucent. The house turns quiet.  Initials carved into dense walls L.O.     V.E.          R. When he left no one remembered his face.  2  The son was made entirely of flesh. He was a runner. He hated to rely on bone. He ran and ran and ran. When he stopped he became a firework.  Sparks that were his eyes left craters on the sidewalk. We opened the fire hydrant and washed him all up.  3  There was a woman of softest flesh. At dusk  she would sit on the porch, rub shoulders until skin bled and sun turned pink.  She gave of herself an offering.  Every morning I found her closer to bone. There was nothing I would not do for any of them. It wasn’t that  streaming like an ablution  I couldn’t say no to  the smell of boy.  Sweat and  around us  the falling moon  but in the shadow  I never used to be  soiled  dark  ready to,  mouth, claw  I wanted to but  It was  always  me,   I wanted to but somehow  through the half-closed window  the dirt under your fingernails,  The husk of your body  the blood on your teeth shone.  All of it shook me:  reflected blankly  a blackened wing  so coy.  I was fecund,  humming spring  like poppies  upward from  a fist  your heft that made me  quail and shake.  like sickness   in the bath of blue light  like a damp spectral sheet  your wild-eye gleam  rapped my eyelids.  Saliva clasped to the air  The light washed,  across my body  whittled dark in the dissolve.  So full of loam and wet,  green like the chattering  I vibrated with yes, yes, yes  sprouted from the  inside. It’s not that  I could not bear it. You  beat my thighs—  Your thickness inside  was never welcome. I’ve let the blood orange you gave me wither with longing. Its blueing  hue sends a strange ash around the desk where I keep it—a reminder  I suppose, of winter’s frozen needling, the warmth of our bed, the promise  of a spring that would surely come. I am not sentimental enough to  keep an orange as an emblem of desire. No. White-fleshed  and bitter, I’m fascinated by its pith, that string that hangs  the meat, white cord that tethers the segment to the spine,  the way the body, in repose, is held together by muscles and tendons,  by an armature of bone. No. I’m not maudlin enough to  remember you by the laden fruit you plucked. It’s simply an experiment  in forgetting: will the blood run through the blue, through the cage?       Appearance, disappearance make the hidden logic visible.  Start with a coin, an orange. A woman goes behind a tree.  A man goes behind the ground.  An explosion of starlings upends the solid, classical architecture.  Ruin is the new sublime: trillium at the salt flats.

Neighbors’ faces lit by blue screens.    Junkies?  Angels?  I want to say the latter although I’ve never heard  of sports bras in all the iconography or miraculous accounts of folks being  saved for a larger purpose which I can hardly imagine as I carry my daughter  who cannot sleep onto the dark porch and up the sidewalk in my arms       my arms  which do this with numb customary strength and if     if they are     they are angels  then the yellow slit of refrigerator light must be the gates opening wide to take them  back to wherever it is that would leave us bereft and I know the world will be different  when they are finally gone—the yew trees outside their windows, for instance.

The bat roosted in the chimes. What’s a girl to do: (a) Pull the screen from the window and wait. (b) Relinquish her roost and glide out over the murky night.   3  I love you, I’m sorry, Please forgive me, Thank you. Time lights everything. Time gives out. A girl lifts off her icy grid into paradise. The island loves her until the island sweetly, unceremoniously, tilts her off. Friday Two gods fight, and you reap the benefits. You may find a gold tooth on the sidewalk. If you don’t, search for street art. A white heart means you will live forever. If someone has painted your portrait, a time traveler has fallen in love with you. Bury your baby teeth and wait for a phone call.    Sunday Wear orange today, so the spirits can see you. Throw away any bills originating from a zip code that ends in zero. Apply blue eye shadow. Place cosmetic jewelry beneath your pillow and go to sleep. If you’re lucky, Elizabeth Taylor will come and replace your rhinestones with diamonds.    Tuesday If the air outside smells like popcorn, call out of work. Clean your closets. Carve a pumpkin. Watch your favorite TV show in real-time. Go outside only if the wind blows a newspaper into your yard. Pay attention to the headlines on the page. If the headlines look like hieroglyphics, you’re the next Nostradamus. When I loved you at the first, I spoke Gullah again Plantains and yams and cassava words my teeth were crisp, aware of my tongue my lips got fat spread across the words diced out in bites of moonlight my throat carried an old way of loving you from someplace we were before there was sun stuck in the trees and no salt in the water and lilacs there were lilacs and we still knew how to eat breadfruit and had no need to bother with the flatness of queen’s English this language of wood, of rust and broken things  Loving you now is heard only in a drone song from the dust imminent and still A dialect of the familiar I pull fire from beneath my skin out of my mouth The way you used to pull hummingbirds from between my thighs My blood is honey in your hands There is more breath than time more alive than extinct but we chose the bitter way knives cut into rotten fruit and don’t fuss over the sorrow of ants       1.  Northwest of the White Mountains, east of St. Albans, site of Southern revenge against Northern aggression, among an embarrassment of ponds, south of Lake Memphremagog, which north of the border becomes Lac Memphrémagog , and directly west of Machias, Maine, 1775’s “Lexington of the seas,” I stood above the frozen pond and wondered how long it might take to die.   2.  Would the ice crack long, before it gave way? Would it hurt? Would I cry out? And if I did, would they hear me up in the house, over the roar of the afternoon’s energy and my son declaiming his toys’ names, again and again? Would I struggle? Or would I slip right in, as into bed, as into sleep, the cold silence bubbling over my billowing hair and heavy, ballooning winter clothes?   3.  As the legend goes, the Pigman —a grotesque amalgam of man and pig, cloven hooves & upturned snout—roams the county, stealing livestock and scaring teenagers. In the woods behind the house, near sunset, the wind wailed through the pines, and we found the failed remains of an old shack. It’s only a myth we said to one another, but disbelieving ourselves, headed for home. but you’ll do something more interesting than that.      You’ll sit, note  the perfect sentinel of  cigarettes, clean bones lined in their crate, waiting,  or the shuddering reach of the flame in staccato bursts  or the milkweed pods ravishing their shells for freedom—sometimes  the only way out of the womb is by force.  When the river got out of hand, emboldened with rain water, the fishermen ran to the shore. Most kept running, dragging waders in thick strokes against the sand, as far as their bodies would go. The bravest, though, ran just to safety and spun to watch the river bloat and bloom further up the shore. The other men ripped their attention like a weed from the river, thought me , thought safety , thought space , but the bravest teased his attention out until he could see both him and river together. Sprinklers stutter on plush lawns and laugh tracks waft through open windows  while down the street, modest brick houses are consumed by the earth’s sudden mouth.  Somewhere in the park, a human body decomposes in a ravine. There, inside of  the trunk of that red ash, sapwood rots, its soft factories of cells thrumming  towards obsolescence. The injuries of time rack everything. The injuries of time are irreparable  and revelatory. The era of declaring eras over continues indefinitely. Praise the living body  for growing new skin. “NASA’s Kepler Spacecraft Discovers New Batch of Earthlike Planets” —National Geographic   Hard to contain my relief— I hope one is like our Earth but devoid of human-like creatures   Only weather  plants and birds that eat them   I imagine falling asleep among the flora and not waking up   not even when it rains      Some burst into colors; some don’t   I am dazzled by the array of colors the mute vegetables offer. Carrots are orange, you say, but sometimes purple or white.  Peppers push out not only simple shiny green cheeks  but turn yellow or chocolate, purple or white or scarlet.  Tomatoes come in every shade but blue.  Sometimes they’re striped like tigers. Sometimes they blush rosy like truly ripe peaches.  Even eggplants can be pink or white though I prefer those glossy purple breasts.  Lettuce sings maroon or speckled ruby or brownish.  But some veggies are staid and won’t vary:  parsnips, peas, leeks, artichokes, just quiet hues of green and white. Myself, I wear any color by mood. I don’t believe in stinting.  I want plumage as bright as a peacock.  Spill the rainbow over me. Age will not dim me. I want to go out in a sunset– bars of cloud reflecting royal purple through green to sulfur still blazing at the end of days. On St. Claude Avenue, stepping out into the day’s wet gust of heat, I am greeted by a chorus of hammers: the old open-air market, nearly collapsed from years of neglect, is getting new bones, and the coffee shop across the street is flocked with U-locked bicycles. Living in New Orleans, I feel sometimes like the woman who invited the ghost of her grandfather to come and visit. Lying in bed, restless and bored, she wanted someone to tousle her curtains, to speak in code, to stand in the corner juggling or tinkering with a jack-knife. What she didn’t realize is that he’d bring friends. As soon as she drifted off to sleep the room filled with a veritable parade, each passing face like a glowing mountain range, and through it all her grandfather stood stock-still grinning: proud, somehow, of her fear. All beginnings are shipwreck. All disasters are natural. All the realm is present, separate though you feel, hacked off, hacked at by yourself, dearest rival.  All the endings are beginnings rich in lost parts washed up on the beach with the tar, the plastic bags, the singing softly singing sand. Feral dreams, snarling, biting at the zookeeper.  All blazes feed the soil, all bodies compost. All hatred justified, unlike the love. All enemies are present, clear, all knowledge of enemies a mirror. All the songs repeat –  grotesque thought avoided as a favor to the father  All the favors trash. All puppies catastrophe, like the wind which is Greek, never more serious than offstage. Howling its approach now, kind lady with pretty journal. Now.  All the nevers are always, nevers thriving inside like Manhattans of eight million dashing to the one secret appointment. Elaborate plumbing networks spare us from the smell of it, of them, of  us swirling in a mélange of knee-jerk fear, the line whispered in a film, you meant to jot it down but it was dark, the pencil rolled away. Still sense hit its marshy target,  a crystal formed, you fathomed forth to the accident connect, the future you imagined before the tinder lit. To Pin However Many Down   or Teasing Apart or Language, Indexing Reality  1.  Abstractus —‘drawn away.’ I need to be. What exists in the mind, blue and intact, but not in physical form. To briefly inhabit ideal problem space, where we distill what is common from everyday phenomena. See the similarity in what is disguised by life as dissimilar. Reduce events to identical mathematical points. But yes, too many blue hydrangeas. Once we’ve taken the differences away, what is left? Idea: Take juggled bowling pins, wobbling tennis rackets, a rotating ax tossed underhand—remove the objects, and what is the subject? What’s left is parabolic motion. And this can be done again: center of mass, conservation of energy, harmonic motion, rotational inertia. Lily-of-the-valley, lilac, sweet autumn Clematis—these whites will do in the moonlight.  2. We are in the present tense. A honeybee homes in on its hive, a bug crawls outward on a horizontal turntable, a bead slides on a wire, a racing car moves on a circle, a small ball is fastened to a long rubber band and twirled, a buzzing fly moves in a helical path, an ant crawls on the surface of a ball, a baseball is dropped from the top of the Empire State Building. Requiring a great capacity for the busy population of now.  3. A gambler hires a physicist and an engineer to help him predict which horse will win the race. In the final analysis, the physicist’s projections are way wrong. What happened? The physicist, baffled, says he solved the problem the same way he always does: a spherical horse travels on a frictionless track with no wind resistance at a constant speed….  4. I am entering a peculiar strangeness, where a thousand questions can be asked about a block of mass m on an incline. Where physical systems usually begin at rest. Where there are force diagrams, whose arrows are barely referential. There are perfect spheres and frictionless pulleys and constant velocities. I do not ask why a spherical ball is attached to a spring underwater. Or why a person stands on a bathroom spring scale while riding in an elevator. Or an armadillo scampers left and right along an x axis. Problem space, the water’s fine.  5. The answers will make the questions meaningful. Only what happens matters. Remove the physicality of bugs and beads and balls , and only objects remain. Objects that drop from height h at time t with velocity v. Real and mental constructs. Every scenario, posed such that: in a spiral path such that , outward on a radial line such that, twirled in such a way that…. Imperatives: Find the acceleration. Find the speed as a function of time. Show that. What sort of path is represented by the above equations? Learn to describe motion symbolically, as you have learned to use your words.

I wonder  if the neighbors, windows open across the driveway, heard me coming.  Did you notice I washed my sheets?   *   I know a bird in your left ribcage. It deepens your neck-pulse as you sleep.  I was hoping you’d see me in my blue underwear.  Tell me  what do you call that sycamore leaf we tracked in,  the one that quakes on the floor?   *   Little dear.  When I pushed you against the bedroom door  you knocked down Frida’s dress of arrows. I didn’t say you could do that. During a coastal rainstorm, I play Sounds of the Sea: Volume I to drown out the thunderclaps.  I’ve been working my way through all of my father’s albums as one long tribute concert, but I’d reserved this oddity. The marine timbre seems fitting now with the rain enclosing my living room like some sort of submarine.  It’s a curious record from 1952, and I can see my father smiling as he finds it amid a dusty bin at an estate sale, where he and my mother would comb through what the dead couldn’t take with them. Album in hand, he’d have turned to her, called out Joy!— flipped it to the side so she could see the title and nod her approval— before slipping it under his arm to keep.  In my father’s house, my mother and I found molded dishes, a rusted jukebox, the blood-spattered couch. But his vinyls, pristine.  My living room fills with analog sound, tall like my father. Underwater gurgles—some as innocent as two children splashing each other in a warm bathtub. Others eerie: “2000 Fathoms Down” moans spectral from another kind of abyss.  Now, the record spins the way his mind spun around the maelstrom my mother left within him. Side A ends, and, for a moment, I let the needle scratch at the center label to replicate the sound of fire in his woodstove where he warmed his feet before he chilled his body. The medics found him cold as the spring water that flowed down from the frozen hills that December.  And even above the sound of the record, thunder booms, reverberates like my father’s laugh, which opened out of him, wide as an estuary, echoes like a shotgun.  I imagine it in his mouth: cold and tasting of metal as he cried. He had to have cried. In all of the versions that play in my head, he cries.  When the rain passes, the record will return to its sleeve. I’ll go out back, unlock the tool shed, and drag my maul across the wet earth to the stump of the ash tree. The remains left for me to remove, bit by bit, after some burrowing beetle ate away at it from within until the tree gave up and the leaves browned and fell to the ground too early in its season. The stump rests in its ruin, a jagged and dead reminder. I drilled holes into its sides, poured in Epsom salts, and it rots a little more with each storm. I hack away, swing the maul in an arc, the way my father chopped wood with his axe, trying to store enough fuel to keep him going through those harsh winters that made it seem as though spring would never come. I return to the stump again and again, drive my wedge into its body.

To not have black dust take X years off my life.  The whitest shade of HDB tile,  like teeth in a mouth. I like to think I’ve done this so many times that it’s nothing . The girl across the aisle wears brown boots,  as does the man in front of her, which shouldn’t matter to me  but I still think of an escalator and the upward lift at a steady pace.  I used to work for a European man who was seldom in the office  and who sent in his receipts from when he drank wine on his flights  at the company’s expense. The laces of the brown boots  are made of the same supple leather. I glued the receipts to paper and filed them.  Two men in front of me order Budweisers. They wear blue caps that say SAFETY ALWAYS.  Soon, one orders another. The stewardess says, “Don’t be scared. If you are, just hold his hand.” Cornfield, wet. Tasselled pompoms of the cheerleaders who drowned on prom night. They shouldn’t have dressed like that. They should have waited for dessert. But a knotty something drove them to water. Too bad he got there late, after the crime, trailing in the wake  When he sings he doesn’t stutter at all & the body at the bottom floats up to the top. Here’s another life story, another reason to lie.  When I turned twelve my father had me  lace my hands under my head, on my back  beneath the mulberry tree, & dropped branches lit  from a matchless canopy. There was no catechism,  no warning, just fire in the abrupt sky.  Wings flared, scoring a vista reduced to  flash, fluted bone, residue & shame. Some ducks fly across the moon. When I was a boy, mercury climbed glass threads and made lemonade. As there are marrows we consider love in our bones. The farthest journey is to nowhere, not a continent. Dear Darling, a beginning and a center too. I suppose I should have been in bed a long time ago. Sleeping is on a train. Some noise is white noise. Some silence is all the other colors. The gray wave expects to clear our railings by the end of today. Its rhythm is patience. Cradled on land then inhaled into walls, water’s in business with a subtle moon. They have a plan but won’t tell. You watch the sea foam simmer from the middle story of a burning building. Its flames blow east the way everyone predicted. It was a matter of time, there was that night you fell asleep with candles burning near the drapes, the day you left a thicket of lint to choke the dryer. The fire forgave you then, but you owed him. Just as you owe the earwig who, for the third day now, waits in your phone’s receiver, pincers sharpening on the stone of their own mercy. You dial someone to insist the worst must be over. Can you hear him tapping? There’s a message in his code: you’re afraid of the wrong catastrophe. The two halves of this city pull at the stitches. River unwound, a wooden spool turning to loosen its coarse gray thread.  It was me who  When you were born I  I was the mother joining scraps for a sleeve.  Your mottled chest rose and fell as I unpinned my hands from your gown. The breathing—still wet, still sudden—I could see it aspire: oil skin stretched across new whale bone.  You were my sea-tossed lamp.  I was the boat, the kerosene, spilt into a dark current where cloth would only pull you below as someone you once knew, a body around your body, made for the shifting sea. Same moon, impossible stars, pesky light beaming in off the parkway; morning, the post-op blue of her eyes  (He called me; I followed) same stars, impossible moon, ferocious slash through the sky like the moment when all is forgiven;  (the hardest part: thanklessness.  After that: waiting;) sky pinched between rock, rutting season, all the way to the drop off,  the interstate strewn with dead deer; (He tells me in the car that he’s patient, sure, but he’s pretty much had it with this this perpetual winter bullshit;) same light, impossible sky, the interstate ferocious, thankless; In my daughter’s blended family therapy drawings, I am always a blonde; across the bridge, same thankless wind sifting ash into darkening heaps; this side of the interstate, same impossible, same waiting, the minimalls hawking spray tans, Steak Nightz, walk-in phlebotomy clinics;  (When she’s gone, it’s like the very ground has swallowed her whole) landscape receding into backlight, then opening in the distance like the exit wound it is- hard sky, dark light, moon thankless, wait ferocious. Nautilus How do you, when you are the hunt, turn the hunt in?  Like a landslide, I am the color of what I push around You say sea sick. I stay landsick with the rest of them  What do swans eat in winter? There is nothing else in the natural world shaped like a hand  Based on the hundreds of fish I’ve interviewed You signed that away to me, you know  Today I was told  Subjective tinnitus is a phantom auditory sensation like cicadas or grinding steel, winds or escaping steam  Can I opt to hear that chosen chorus? You never hurt me but you stand far enough away to let the world hurt me on her own  I am not a hurting God, not cruel I don’t want to live behind a collection of knives in your eyes, or anyone’s  Today I was told  Vertigo is an inappropriate sense of dizziness  What is appropriate? You signed that away to me, you know  Wake up with snakebites on my hips Bone bleeds a lot. You are servant of my summer  Today I was told  A ‘brui’ is the sound of blood rushing around a blockage A ‘thrill’ is what it feels like under your hands  On the table I felt bloodier, purple-red and gritty You stand between me and the true garden, dressed in white  Which one of us is the swan in this situation? In rushes with the relics of our past attempts to ration  Today I was told  “Pain is the prayer of the bone for better blood” You threw the fish back in the lake It’s called a thrill in your hands        This is the old way to lake, before the birds moved in. Like you, I am a diver. In the wolf hour  I stand still as kindling. The sun eats the trees and the air eats me.  You wanted something scientific to happen, wanted to keep moving downhill,  like a stream. But sorrow moves in six directions, not a channel could hold it.  Life’s not anchored like that. I would know. I bathe in it every morning. Hedda jammed chip clips in her hair rubbed her scabs with sour balls raised welted hands to the moon whistled away the room’s sewage smears the vining prickles       the hardened loam  She got all emotional in the van         by the teakettle          filled with margarine here in Hades           with its clear view           of the Earth with all its elk            and the Yessirs         and the orchids and the galoshes         and the prisons         and the walnuts  Here, the food goes in           the food goes out Hedda chewed up the abacus she chewed up her fingers this             her run-on sentence the rapture sits idly by. I am growing up now. I appreciate “nightgowns,” adore a quiet street, only munch my cracker sandwiches in secret. I hide my farts, fear Chase Checking, have flex spending. I ate  a rice cake. I spit it out, begged on the street, spent that cash on pills. Belched on the train, tore up Bleeker in a rag dress and wore genie pants to bed. Everyone has a breaking point, I said. Can’t call that a cake. I bought a vanity vibrator. It’s made-to-order,  fitted to me, my O. I named it Aladdin. I am growing up now. I chomped down a tree from leaves to roots just to watch an old man cry and I spit it to the wind like the mama bird I am, I am.       Nights you & I scavenged the neighborhood between the docks & community swimming pool. We trespassed chain-linked fences,  welded night to accident, spray-painted stop signs black & scrapbooked with broken glass.  We were learning the accidents of birth & tires, that intent was dangerous. We wanted to be beyond the limits of our lives,  more than girls drawing, but women who drew men in, who knew everything ended in flowers.  We spent our lives casting—even then I preferred fantasy, Lucky Stripe candy cigarettes,  the pink tips so unlike fire, more like the burn of lipstick than flame. I didn’t know how things worked,  that wives filled in the details of their dead husbands’ affairs. What truths deserve to be protected?  I remember one October night, we smoked our glow sticks the only way we knew how, little nibbles & big swallows,  as if our throats craved the obscurity of smoke. Maybe worshipping threat was the only way we knew to be saved. Maybe we baited firetrucks  because when a red van pulled alongside & a man in a ghost mask leaped out, we screamed the way only blood can.  Then we ran the way our mothers taught us. The truth, one soap opera diva to another, is that we jumped, but we jumped in.  The metal felt sure in its criminal enterprise, more sure than the masked driver with wide brown eyes, less sure than the asphalt beneath the tires.  How to say, we dived into a stranger’s van? How to say, we were disappointed they didn’t torture & kill us? Only in soap operas can  Delene Brookvalley say, hurt us please , to Chantilly Mountaincrest & not be ashamed. & now I know chaos is what happens  when one of us renegotiates a mutual story— somewhere in between those van doors sliding open, our need to bleed, & home,  we fled as masked men chased us, we fled as masked men. Will trade one story of crocodiles climbing trees for a banister draped in a fishing net, and a ball of mending twine  Will trade the slice of tires on wet roads for milkweed pods left to open in the wind or evidence thereof  Will trade my hush and suffering of fools for a clamshell of paper plate, a puddle of butter  Will trade a walk for a clothesline, a rabbit for a different rabbit, will trade a flashlight for hyacinth bulbs  Will trade my hand spun comfortable lie or fairy tale for the renewed ability to believe it  Will trade lint for mussel shells, whole, hinged, or hollow—condition negotiable, opalescent interior preferred  Will trade three meetings and a door held politely open for a box of mislaid letters and their envelopes  Will trade my grandmother’s pearl earrings, secreted in a shipment of baubles, for a bowl of soup split two ways  Will trade an attic of National Geographics and permission to use the maps as wrapping paper for three uninjured cardinals  Will trade mist rising from a lake or a cup of coffee for a water snake moving on or what have you. There are too many beginnings & no point.  We could say the scarf was knit with one skein. Sooner or later, someone will unravel it just to 	know; just as well  we start with the big words.  But the peninsula stood unsurrendered , I wrote in eighth grade.  & She laid down her arms , in ninth.  A paraphrase, then: the man’s boat was a ’57 corvette.  We could have all the catheads to house our anchors & all the lighthouses to match.  While the cities continue to flood.  Under the jacaranda, it is easiest to notice something sudden & scrawled in a corner—  The baby the baby the baby the bay. There was the murmur of too quick rainfall. There was stone on pocketed stone, bride & chicken in a clover field at standoff. More even. But who could be trusted with whole truths. Here the bride’s skirts grow more & more tulle every time she clinks a glass, adjusts a ring. The poignancy was over—at a distance, at least— A thousand mosquitoes abandoned the jacaranda; the bees already gone for weeks.        I taste the edges of my mouth and find salt to flavor my supper. I shake my head and silver salt flakes from my hair. My black jeans look wintry with a white rime on the cuffs. On the beach all the dogs lick me with the small red rags of their tongues. If I lived by the sea forever, I’d wear a garland of salt crystals. I’d walk in a cloud of salt and salt would be my sister. Lately you don’t feel the angel in your room. The dim shaft of white that attends the darkness is just a bathrobe limp at the closet door. You are not a child anymore, but you are still afraid. On Sundays, you walk your daughter to Sunday School in her Mary Janes, hands on her shoulders, steering her blindly at God. Every Sunday, you wait in the hall while your child sings with the other children. When she runs off, your hands collapse to your thighs, a short but dreadful plunge. At night, you lie in bed afraid the angel that has never left you has left you. What has become of your life? The slender drape of your robe is a candlestick whose light is snuffed, wick smoldering a dark ceiling across your body and the body of your husband who does not believe. In the evenings, a small voice sounds from the room across the hall. This little light of mine, she sings. The light is on in her room when you enter, sleepless. She sleeps, the cool shell of her curled body. Every night, your daughter has kicked off her covers. Night by night, you are learning to leave her bared. She is not you. You believe in this new child come into the world despite you, entirely herself.

Watching soccer, it’s hard not to recall what you’ve lost and will. Oak leaves fold into green goblets. Branches strain in a wind that tears at quick‐stepping teens barking into phones. Hard to live in this scant range of time and climate and then slowly edge off the frame as though you’ve spilled wine on your pants. You’re simply old, or at least older, which rankles your boss since you care less if you sound lucid, since you wear your bald mortality like a badge. On the field, kids are soaked through but, tonight, no parents exhort them to shoot. They plod on, splashing, as cones of wet light settle over their match. my mother is sick & can not leave her bed most days. i am of my mother & therefore i am sick too.  i am of my mother & so i race to ﬁnd a cure for us. i leave that house & walk away from the dim lit faces  of the mumbling televisions. my mother is sick & therefore i am sick too i tell the woman i sleep with. i leave that house  spanish moss hangs from a tree growing in brooklyn & it’s a terminal thing i share with my mother.   you are so much like her my father shakes his head side to side in a bar, i always feared you would be   & paige, that way he says, after telling him the prognosis. i ate my hands to keep from touching myself.  i gave my things away, only to come back to bed surrounded by the things i’d given away. you haven’t been right   for some time my friend says, while she dips her hands between my thighs— thinking maccabee,  thinking oil, —& other miracles in the wrong language.  my mother is sick & i am of her & therefore i am sick   too , i say.  what surrounds us are not ghosts but one another. if i could claw my eyes out to keep from seeing  i would, but i ate my hands & talons just last week, in an attempt to cure this thing—  would you be a dear & take them from me?  you would still be able to feel the gravity of the earth  my friend says. you’d still feel the moon tugging the oceans .  i know, i know, but i’ve got to try something i say.  if i could get milkweed or what ever you want to grow from the holes in my face, if i’d been better  at folding paper cranes, pronouncing dubious words in their native french, at least one of us  would  have had a chance to leave here with something we wanted.       She was up front, said:    I had sex. I’m not a virgin now.    The ribs of the steering wheel  expanded, pressing into my grip.    So. She said.    On the windshield: dead insects and  dust thrown off bird wings at impact.    The guy. I said.    Yeah .    And we rode forth in single syllables  except for the word virgin , which fell    from her passenger-side window,  broke open against the shoulder.

Look at him, Starling. Tell me what you see.    or, still life with crime scene photos and newspaper clippings   We will know him by the bodies of his work:  an arm unsleeved of skin, and another,  a blouse split up the back like a ladybird.   Witness in the mudwell of a bootprint: gunpowder and mothwing.  There, a ditchdeep arrangement of ankles.  Here, a headline reads:  Fathers, Hide Your Daughters. Are you a bird in a woman-suit, Clarice?  Some pretty little blood sparrow— such lungspan, such bright palpitation:   redthread.         redthread.         redthread.  Peeled back, you are the same shade of robin-redbreast.  You are plucked up.  Ready for love to wear you like a girl-pelt  and preen.  What to think of your burnt sugar baby housed in the fleeting heat, eerily free of color? I sign away my safety, walk among the bricks. The temporary Karo “black boys,” resin-made ready mades melt and sigh beneath broken bone rafters. Her face is inscrutable, unshaded, the fine sugar slipping, chasing after history, creeps between breasts where a girl stands, puts fingers in a V, a sign for peace. Her friend takes her photo, their laughter curls like smoke into air, where the light can’t reach. Here, I feel most how the past is unseen, how the human soul refuses to come clean. When I see woodcuts, my skin recognizes the tacky, reluctant belief that grooves in soft pulp once drank eagerly, gutters rough-hewn by a blistering grip on the knife.  Some ink as deep as aged wine: wax and smashed berries paint somebody’s solitude.  Umbilical transfer, those bumps of translucence, the paper’s blind mouths.  When I see woodcuts an oak door dies, sighs in its jambs; I see a sky that is pasture of spring lambs and tincture of gold spelling capital       C over chateaux and convents culverts and cottages; corridors, torches stuck into iron sconces.  Then earth moves and C bleeds and everyone’s winter with candlelit skulls.  Or a cloud is a moth that is eating away.     This is how, the old printmakers say, we hold on: with this angular texture and trace, with these broadsides that take on the weight of the bodies that made them. I’ll never be able to offer myself like a tray, not to lovers or children or God.       Not that way.        On television, the wife  fixes what’s broken by hand. Darning his socks, she pushes her hips to the dryer, her chores completing all at once. And the husband, home after commercial, pumps and pumps while her closing eyes settle somewhere over his shoulders,  waiting for flight. Most nights, after watching, I press myself to myself in the empty marriage bed, flattened and shaking, during the winter of our first year.  Without you, I become both groom and bride: one hand a mender, one hand a liar. When I said yes I meant line from banty to gullet. I meant delay  from gazing at my own face in the mirror. I said yes.  Every promise the life of flour in the wind. I think  I loved you. When I said it I meant  for now. When I said it I was hiding the bloodied  straw from the sheep.           Jeremiah is the butterfly in this poem, clothed in your nimbleness, your light love that he tore. You are the husk in this poem. Jeremiah and the crill. Jeremiah who you loved in the willows, his nimble fingers on your rib skittering like birds on a wire. Every morning, his side of the bed empty. You a meaty thing, unshaped pulp he could molt when he grew too lovely. Jeremiah and the crill. Jeremiah and you, the husk. Jeremiah, gone from you gone from gone. Jeremiah, the birdless willow tree, the wingsome, winsome, on the wing.  i.  a city of patina and dross: old men in blue coats weep in train stations, squares of soap, bones of light.  the city touched your skin, turned it into cerements. I comb your hair  in the opiate dark. you say you know the hagiography of birds but you cannot weaken the glass wool of memory.  ii.  once you filled a whale carcass with jasmines petals but your hand reaching into absence  is still only a hand in the Atacama Desert  where women have sought for decades for the bones of their loved ones, their bodies breaking into siroccos, into amethysts. After the long winter, ferns uncoil and a heart quickens in the mud. Here, where road crews sweep tar across the cracked roads, the dog rolls in a nest of violets. In the country I left, shots ring out over a black field. This morning, a boy’s neck was severed in the back of a police car. Now the driveway fir is full at the bottom, bald at the top. Green sap blankets the car and the trashcan lids. I want toward the dark creek bed, the low wires crossing the lawn. At first, I notice not the cart girl but her shoes: Purple. Toes tipped with pleather teddy bears. She lifts her ladle full of hog skin curls in hen-foot broth. She points and says my hair is yellow as the sunshine in America.  She says Transformers, Madonna, Beyoncé, Titanic . She says American girls are all in love with love. American girls are all in sex with sex. She taps her muddy gym-shoe bears. We both laugh a bit hysterically.  In Florida, once, this crypto-hobo hipster took me dumpstering, and, sorting rotten fruit from good, told a parable that down there , all women are the same shade of America. I laughed again. I laughed politely. I feel terrible enough  to reach into the earth, straight to America, and pull him through.  Today, my mom Skyped in to say my cousin died: a razor blade, risperidone. As kids, we’d play Columbus. She’d stand up tall—naked, wearing bubbles—and yell THIS BATHTUB IS AMERICA .  The hog skin vendor hands her baby off to me. She wants a picture for her mama in Shanghai who, wearing coveralls, paints yellow hair on novelty angels for America.  When I sleep, I see vixen eyes that leap like sparklers into ditches. I see pleather bears searching for honey in the marigolds that find themselves encased in amber waves of dew.  Do you think every dream should be a dream that someone has of you, America? If window, if scaphoid, if beak of the rock-struck warbler, then stickball, then sidewalk, then sling and stone that flies. They demand splint and plaster, nail and brace and glue. They beg grass to bend for a meadow of runners, but all pliable wishes die inside the bone.  What I’ve forgotten of compromise I know of sacrifice: The spent myocardium. The faith that makes men tear temples down. There’s a boy: his voice. A woman: the tide that sweeps her baby in. Frogs into song. Thunderstorm and then elm. Me: bridge. Me: milk tooth. Me: awl of dawn that perforates horizon’s belt.  To get a hundred million parts, you must ransom one whole. Just pray fingernail, levee, fever. I promise to wait for you where the high-tensile fence divides intact from fracture, but I’m also cross-knuckled fingers that say undo, undo. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God,  that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days. –Revelation 12:6   A milksnake curls around the throat of a woman                 in a milkwhite dress. Her knees mud-scabbed                    her mouth a bouquet of stitches                  finger pricked, three drops of blood on the spindle, the thorn, the razor  blade dropped on the garden path                there are other girls in the woods who have stuffed their mouths with sweet- bread mushrooms                 who have scaled the tower              with gun powder beneath their nails 	         hair snarled with burrs  blood                  children strapped to their backs and knives to their thighs manna, salamander, heart-root.  The riverwater churns cold. White sheets bloom with roses of blood. What if the story is a thread, a wire, a snake, a rope that moors the flat- bottomed boat to the bank and the water is dark and filled with eels?  Girls with their mouths sewn shut               tongues cut out wedding cake stuck              to the roofs of their mouths clamber in                 dresses translucent with rain. Untie the knot, cut the rope. The dragon opens his grimy eye. Snake, speak:   The boats choke the stream, there are so many and so many more will drown. Out here in the wilderness hunger gathers its cloud like the point of a storm touching down. I.  Somewhere, the syrup of my mother drips into a bed guarded by a nurse I’ve never seen.  Six years old and basting in the steam of chickenpox, I marinate inside an oatmeal bath, carve  a message on construction paper that my father drops off at the rehab center.  Sleep is a knife that splits my body into tiny cubes.  II.  My mother stirs in the lonely center of her room. Oven of her sheets  turned to 400 degrees, she pours her sandwich bag of herbs into a pot,  adds two gritty-critically-acclaimed documentaries from Netflix, three People magazines.  The batter smells of glazed eyes, half-dreams truncated  by brightness from the TV screen, breathless feel of falling past a brink.  III.  My mother grew as a plump tomato on a vine but has since been pulverized  into a sauce, the process gentler than you’d think. The heat of melting like the onset of a dream:  the body liquifies and then becomes the air, evaporates instead of dies.  IV.  I am a gutted animal that roasts beneath my comforter, heat of tossing  in my own grease. My body swallows space it did not know was there, soaks  like a spill into my sheets. Once I baked inside my mother for a year,  boiled safely in the water of her womb, and even after that I poured myself  into her frame: she was a bowl that gave me shape.  V.  Mom are you the steam that rises somewhere nobody can reach  or is it me looking to escape. Mom will I drift as vapor  from your warm container or simmer into you.  Mom even though I’m over here I’m also curled within your belly,  recalling how my body slept before it grew.       Lover as   bone Lover as tree Lover as three long needles entering your ear while receiving acupuncture at the Y.  Stretch blithely on this chair and soon what is invasive turns to pleasant tingling. You will feel the burden  lifted from the gnarled network of your back. You will need to sign a waiver. Lover as a sink in which you scrub  the soil from your hands, flakes of skin descend as you exfoliate the closet at your friend’s where you slept  without your bra atop a bag of chips, woke with moon-shaped bite marks on your shoulder blade. Your hands retain the smell.  One day Lover calls you Home. You never even knew you had a door. Lover as cold sigh, Lover as wet ground in July which devours  feet so you shrink distinctively with each step. Lover wants to see another sci-fi film but honestly you cannot bear one more man  -beast hybrid flashing fangs across the screen. You want to teleport behind the monster, clamp his jaw, scream out  “ I will not be eaten! I am no one’s food!” Lover as a dissertation on eighteenth century marriage politics  as demonstrated by Austen’s Emma . Lover as a poem scrawled across a Denny’s bathroom stall condemning emptiness of sex.  “ In and out of me like you’re in the bedroom and then out the door.” Spit up Lover in the toilet, slam the cover, flush. Like rain  the Lover does not disappear without return. Memories come in waterfalls and droughts. Desperately you hunt for instances  you’ve shared, glossy back flushed across your bed. When will Lover turn to soil and harden under snow,  splintered sprout recycled into ground. Lurking tendrils of a voice you can’t recall  while scrubbing dishes in your empty home. Today I’m learning all Ten Beneﬁts of Lifting Weights With Your Vagina. For instance, Increase Your Shriveling Vitality! Fight Stubborn Baby Flab! Get In Touch With Your Female Fuckability! I hate websites that capitalize every word, but I myself have dreams of aggrandizement: with a cunt that strong, I could raise a spinning globe from ground to sky, oceans spiraling between my thighs. Next up, the universe! Still, picking up objects means putting them down, and I prefer the thought of terminal ascent—bodies slurped up by Heaven, my cervix like an angry magnet sucking everything into its cleft. How far can I expand? Although I’m used to parting as an ancient sea, black skirt wrinkled at my feet, what ﬂows in falls out— see the ﬂood of rotting ﬁsh vacating my rotting ﬁsh! Read Eight Reasons Why He Won’t Stay! The seventh says I am inherently a jealous lover, which is to say I’m ﬂexing muscles that are weak, your body bigger than what I can hold. Why wouldn’t I despise my own fragility? I used to get off on feeling small, my legs like grass blades in your hands. How To Be Diaphanous! How To Be the Doe Getting Fucked Raw By The Ram! As owner of Earth’s Most Powerful Vagina, I cackle at the notion of a coy debut, dressing my ﬁgure as an offering. At the center of all matter, nothing else can move. You, stuck here— isn’t that what strength is all about? Behold the cosmic stubble of my black hole! Surrender to my superhuman cunt! I’m swallowing the moon and cumming out stars! I’ve ﬁlled the sky up with my rancid smell, stretched so wide you can’t get out. As always, we speak in barely-threaded whorls coiling toward the next distant glint, the next ether –no matter how faintly it glows– and we grip what reins we can hold,  but our speech slips the bridle, intent on its own agency, its own joyous digression, keeping its range as it loops and loops       the way the Mississippi starts as a stream with no hint of eventual breadth or meander,  until  its tributaries part and braid their scattered  ways, quadrupling, and quadrupling again, only to reconvene on the downstream side of the sandbars and twine themselves  back into one unit, one broad valley full of that same water, the river finally existing  in a single delta, yielding itself to an alluvial zone where sometimes we drown, sometimes learn to swim.  Kneeling at the wasp drummed creek of you, where the blank elm whitens into chalk, I am not consoled.  Everywhere is dusk and oiled crow, slatted sky and the wind’s torn harp. There is no entering you  you of the weed scrubbed ochre field, you of the spider rooted grasses taking hold, you who have let the landscape enter you  crowding out every thing that thirsts. I thirst, and find no slaking here on my knees on  the caked gravel bank  of you, the droughty ash laden parch of you, the wrung creekbed of your depleted rill, so I will leave you to your own arid beck  and call forth my own monsoon with this petition to every thing that rains and floods, to every thing that’s blue and wet and soaking  and I will drink and drink and drink and bathe and drench the unyielding dust of you until I am clean and you unfurl and bloom. No escaping the pinch and rapture of living. Across my back, a jagged row of rotten teeth clenched shut. I had caught the sun in the melanin of my skin. Now nothing left but truant cells floating lazily in formalin. But I was here, stopped mid-death, dripping pitch like honey from the cleaved hive. a Tel Aviv crown sonnet that’s missing a bike seat     1. The audacious-yellow chrysanthemums were terrible drunks—they shouted, shaking, and kicking in their basket down Ibn Gavirol, till everyone was nodding in sympathy from their shops and cafes, or laughing outright. My daughter and I escorted the bike like flickering, bright shadows, the ones that make visible the daze  of November in a calendar. I cannot explain my untoward behavior. I’m into fragmentation as an aesthetic. I love to be interrupted every thirty four seconds by the chirping of offspring and the bowl-haircut of the—good thing  2 I am. I just took twenty minutes to do an internet search and discover the atricapullus that darts into the balcony every other day is after  the hamster, not his food. One of the races of the Eurasian Jay, a useless species designation— Garrulus glandarius —the junk-drawer of species.  To find it I searched for “jay” and “crow,” since I wasn’t sure which one it was, and apparently, Linnaeus didn’t know, either—he called it Corvus glandarius .  There are 33 subspecies, one of which is the atricapullus , of which  3. there are 4 groups—“Middle East, Crimean and Turkey”—does the online encyclopedia not recognize Israel or Palestine? My new phone puts flirty texts in quarantine— is it an orthodox phone?—I thought the object of my desire was flirting back, but now suspect he’s simply clumsy; hence the brushing of fingers and palms when passing red peppers and tomatoes and all objects that cause a palm to cup and curl. And since that dinner with the wine he’s been most polite, as a nude shade of lip-gloss. Dear Brandel, Today the pomegranate season in Binyamina ended,  4. and at the gate to the pomegranate farm was a bin of enormous burnished globes so ripe they were splitting, and spitting warm juice at the bees. They cannot be sold in this condition, damaged as they are, so we asked the workers, who nodded and told us to take what we wanted. We filled our arms, we had a car. They were exquisite, so  tart that it took very little wine to ease my friend’s husband’s complete incompetence with the babies (though he took paternity leave, and she worked full time in the city). It’s not my problem, let it go. Maybe it’s worth it to her to have a baby,  5. then two babies, and a house with a garden. Love, (this makes me feel like a total bitch) Marcela. Kingdom: animalia; Phylum: chordata (that’s the bird—nothing rhymes with bitch) class: aves; order: Passeriformes family: corvidae; genus: garrulous species: C. glandarius; binomial name: garrulous glandarius. Subspecies  there are 33 in eight groups. And there are many categories of fathers: the natural , the good provider, the henpecked, the it’s normal for men to bond only when the child is older, the broken bottle to the woman’s bare neck form  6. of diplomacy, which simply disguises a certain male sensitivity and fear of asking, “can we talk?” To a mother who prizes the well being of her child this will be clear. She’s aware at all times that pressure exerted anywhere on her person is an indication that the father’s needs are not being met. This is not  rocket science. It’s better to be smart than right . Joanna lives on the Philistine side of the ancient Ella Valley that parts the two kingdoms (on the Israel side of the green line). Yesterday we climbed to the fortifications from which David descended (indicated  7. by the lack of non-kosher animal bones among the charred debris, but it’s just a good guess) into the tribal battle with Goliath between the two encampments (the ruins of both still remain visible from the battle plain). We picked almonds from the trees, and olives. Such wonderful labor–the green rain  of the olives in the trees, or maybe green notes. Between the fingers they were silk. Raz promised to wash and sort and pickle them. Happy to believe you can preserve a day. In the parks from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem the Arabs and the Druze are doing the same.  8.  Mama, I had the strangest day: First I kept thinking that the tree in the schoolyard was a witch tree. Then I thought I saw a jaguar in it. The next thing I knew, I was playing soccer . We’re done reading Narnia. I don’t know who the intended audience for The Wind in the Willows is. The charmed bachelor creatures haven’t worked in their lives;  they live alone and do not procreate, no children except for poor field mice, who receive charity. Herbivores, they eat meat. No women except to provide a disguise (disguised as a washerwoman Toad defeats the barge woman who, in exchange for laundry service  9. offers him a ride. It is below his dignity to  know how to wash clothes).  That was the couplet. We’ve eaten dessert first, and how we have to do the work to compensate our pleasure. Like giving birth after a love fest. Our landlady urged  us to stay as she came to collect the rent. She gave us chocolate, asked if we were happy and if she could raise it symbolically  for her peace of mind at least. And so caught off guard we said yes. And she paid for the new toilet though I hadn’t asked for a receipt  10. so the handyman wouldn’t have to pay VAT. We were so shocked that the next school day my daughter saw a bear and a snake in the tree, then got upset that all the time I was looking, her classmates wanted also to see. It was the first time I thought maybe something is really wrong. But when I looked, there really was a snake.  Sharron saw it, too, and then we walked in golden light—there is no other way to say it, though it’s clichéd. Is it forbidden to walk in honeyed light because it’s a cliché? Even the birds’ white breasts turned gold overhead like the straw in the hands of the maid  11. in the Rumpelstiltskin story. Yes they flew along the river to the sea, they flew through sunset and were stained for days—we saw them later in the week while replacing the bicycle seat someone had stolen from our building— signaling the end of the two-year chain of enchantment that had kept us from harm. Soon we saw that every bike on Weizman was similarly lacking a seat; my child began to look around and grin through her tears until it was unseemly  how the bike frame’s nudity enjoyed my girl’s gaze and schadenfreude. I.  Dear B:       tonight  is a cold cliff I lean over.     Tonight is a fair  blank face.       Think of the way light  lusters an edge of something,       sharpens a stand  of poplars.       Think of the way an animal faces the baying  hound,      the night air  warming around the hound’s tongue,       the rain spraying  surrender into the animal’s fur.       Each year, the land  crushes new parts of itself into the water.       It dreams of the sea’s roar,  of the sea’s mouth,       of the fling  of itself down the sea’s throat.       It dreams that each strand  of seagrass began in a dry meadow             and wonders whether it can begin  there again if it closes its eyes. 	Dear B: I cannot bring  this night into focus.    I cannot bring myself in.   II.  In a late August garden,       summers ago,  I watched as a thrush brought  a snail down against a rock until its shell broke.       The thrush’s song was a low  tremolo as it dismantled the snail’s softness and we—  me and my two eyes watching—thought  is this what it’s like to be a pebble in the mouth of the sea?   III.  Daybreak:        the sky is faith-  white,    is closed as a cockle shell from cloud-shore  to cloud-shore.       The horizon is a furled  sound that loosens with light until, at noon,    all I hear  is the glare, the waves’ roar  like a razor blade under my tongue   until dusk, when the water’s breath  blurs even the whelk’s spires.   Dear  B: I lied about the cliff.       I am already falling through one world   IV.  and into the other.       There is something halfway true  in this.   There is no other world, but I have already fallen into it,       and it seems  clearer. 	Between my dreams  of the panting hound, 	of the shell-less snail—             a new  dream: 	light  on a meadow. 	      Vast heat.       A pain  white and soft as milk, 	and plain  as a blade of grass,       as a bird’s flight  drawn against a cloudless night. If Gravity   is a yield.  Is the falling into  of a field.  If of sunflowers.  If you fall  into their orbits  with heavy-headed hunger,  with urge.  If curvature.  If a million mirrors  mirror the suns  you bury yourself among.  If you’re uprooted  and flung  toward the sun,  face-first.  If perihelion.  If your faith  to the field  is uncertain  as a hawk’s flight  from a lureless glove.  If so, then rest somewhere  between these two  surfaces of sun  in an endless catch  and fall.  Let your face  face the direction  you came from. My eyes rove over this slow meadow,  this tundra, cathedra  of sundogs and solar wind,       which stitch  my sight with froth,  with snow wraiths.        I have forgotten the movement of the ocean.   In  its place:        a blue tongue rolling down the nave of  my brain, licking the idea  of ocean into dry ice, into a halo of diamond dust.        Coldest  hallucination, particulate sheen, shun  my eye.  Shut it  inside the oyster of your sky.     Let me be  your grit, your snowy ache.     Bed me like a pearl.      Lay me  in the field of your nacre. Wanting out no matter what, the cow jumped. Standing on watch along the fence line, suddenly in the path of her leap, I fell to the ground to dodge her havoc of hooves. Landing clear, she pulled the four live wires loose from the posts, down onto me, their pulse taking over mine. She entangled me in her need to get free. My parents watched, unmoving, amused, uncertain of what to do. With each shock, my limbs blinked into disconnection. To get free fast, these hands had to lift, the legs had to kick the wires. They snapped back into place like puppet strings. Eyes going black in the aftershocks had to be shut. Then this body had to turn off and pull. After the first few attempts I thought they would run to the switch, cut my voltage, grab my shoulders, pull.  I’m not touching you. Get yourself out. My sister’s father wore steel-toed boots as mean as a machine gun. Once, fences down but full of current, the cows gone to flowers, she and her dad, my mother and I gave chase. The wild heifers ran free, fearful as rioters. Far across the field, I saw my nine-year-old sister step on a wire, collapse to the grass, start to cry. Loathing the echo of his own pain within her sob, her father started stomping on her the way he once squished a pregnant mouse in the oats, fetuses bursting pink from its side. Face down, all three hundred pounds of him brought to bear through that boot against her spine, she was supposed to shut up. She couldn’t. Thirteen, I ran toward her shouting his first name, his full name, getting closer and louder the way a father handles a son who won’t listen, commanding him to stop, stop that right now, until the words inverted us, his gaze furious against the authority in mine. He froze. I was going to take his daughter, bruised to the bone. Was he going to defend his claim, charge at me? I wasn’t ready to be a father. I was ready to run faster than his fat ass could catch, my daughter safe in hand, get to the road, wave down anybody, show them her back, his bootprints blooming purple, winding around her vertebrae. Instead, like a teenage bad boy in a hit and run with his dad’s waxed Camaro, he fled the scene.        She drives the road that clings to the mountainside like a first love. She doesn’t think of her split-second calm at her infant’s still chest, or the throb of dread at its rise. Nor of the woman that gathered her children when she smelled smoke, locked them in the closet in fear of the flame. She doesn’t think of the buoyancy of the body, or of the ease of the holding under. It would never cross her mind to shut the garage door and turn the key. To press hard fingers against that soft spot. To give aspirin instead of Tylenol. To cut something into fourths instead of eighths or sixteenths.  Why should it? The moon has slit open the black of the sky, and its light brightens the cliff side beautiful. It hovers like a comma, a breath between the clauses of the cosmos. She inhales, pauses at the top of a breath where the body believes it will get easier. The baby shifts in the backseat, a rattle complains when it hits the floor.  She inches toward the white line. She doesn’t think of impact. Of bones and blood and dirt and metal. Of ambulances or hospitals, life saving measures or funeral arrangements. Of how blame will be placed, suffering divided. She is already under—the broth of the bay settled on her tongue, the moon a sliver in the black of her eye. o. I once was a bottle rocket. I once was a haystack-caught-fire.

He forgets I am simmering, a blue French onion soup forgotten on the stove. Or maybe I am the apron he never wears, the blue-eyed girl, now woman, now stale perfume, a blue knob on the blue door he never opens. Maybe after twenty years, the shimmering moon outlining my hips is just a shadow and my fingers in his mouth, just a distraction—blue nightgown, blue robe, blue koi in the pond look black without sunlight. Maybe it should be enough to be his aftermorning, his second best, blue gun in my shivering, blue mint, blue mind. Maybe I should have been born happy, a blue velvet lady riding the ferry and noticing all those disappearing stars, all those little deaths across a blue night, blue nebula holding the sea I ride in on as if all my blue could be contained, drawn into the sky. So open-palmed: to peaches, to the swell of a baby inside a woman’s belly to the cheek of a woman we think we know. So willing to share our grievances about the length from hip to hem, those lines up the back of the legs being stockings, the heels over the heels of a woman wobbling down the street filled with bars. A sign at the market proclaims from the fruit: don’t squeeze me ‘til I’m yours and our mouths water even more, small boys pretend not to read and touch the fuzz, giggling.

One day I will actually see a meteor shower. The kind where I own a pickup truck and one day out of the week we park it in a field where we’d typically watch the ocean, but this one day you are wearing a tank top and I can’t believe I’ve ever seen so much of your shoulders.  One day I will find more hobbies. Because fastening the latch on your locket – lingering with the doormat upon exit of your apartment – they’re not really hobbies I can share with just any old friend. Tonight, my stomach is frantic like it accidentally released a large handful of balloons and now somebody is here and they want all of those balloons for a party where folks will surely be expecting them.  One day I will not roll over onto your cat. I pray your cat will one day stop sleeping on my side of the bed.  One day I will find the courage to surprise you with a handful of things that exist in the sky. Perhaps you will wear the tank top. Perhaps it will be a Friday when I’ve sneaked away from work and we will park the truck in a field and we will look up to track a meteor shower or a dozen balloons heading north into the mountains, and when the night comes we will realize what we loved about the moonlight was that it was always the sun.  One day the sun will promise you to reach your pen pal Ned and give old Ned your warm regards. Today is red, the boys are swinging sticks at a hive in the neighbor’s yard, porched grandparents singing this is my dreaming glass while wiggling in the wind the way women will their fingers when showing painted nails. The dogs are silent            and you notice this for dogs are often barking. There’s a beard in the paper published for its luminosity. The boys are in the fireplace now, they are only climbing it or sneaking cigarettes but the grandparents are still breaking in their skeletons. You contemplate the 1930’s, the jazz and filibustering for beer while the boys continue with their tongues in a socket. And you think that you want to have wisdom and love and a Cadillac Deville. A water aerobics course to stave the arthritis. How lovely old age! Lest you cripple your legs or cancer your gums or simply die before your grandchild’s piano recital—Funeral March of a Marionette. Surely they will mourn even though you’ve urged the contrary: balloons and your dentures in a glass of good whiskey. But it’s likely they will mourn and anyway, the dogs are barking again and you really ought to find those boys. Where in fall they burn the dirt of Robert Frost’s own grave.  Where they call his ashes dragon and sift through them for teeth.  Where smoke is the only produce of the factories.  Where the man whose jawbone throbs must punch himself to sleep.  Where dawn’s the sun hung above a field of blood-wet greens.  Where the word blunt is just as violent as it seems.  Where grammar is the mutilated cousin of the breeze.  Where one’s children are the animals one can’t bring oneself to eat.  Where the appeals of songbirds are to be redacted from the trees.  Where cities are for rats and whatever tolerates the rat’s acerbic meat.  Where it’s useless tracing rivers if you’re looking for relief.  Where ground bones excel in any powder’s place.  Where it must have fur if it’s a masterpiece.  Where feeding flesh to fire is the only argument capable of grace. In the kitchen, you hold a pepper like a heart before  dropping it into the skillet. There, it turns into a real  heart. It pumps at regular intervals as it sizzles. I have  to find who owns this heart, you say. Light pulses across  its surface like breath against a windowpane. Your  face glows orange as you watch the heart. You inhale  the smell—myrrh, burning blood, and gold. God, my brother says to me, and I say: No. A Calvary of speech. The spirit chases you, he says, meaning the Holy one, God’s brother-self. I’m lazy  on the theology. My chrism brother, brother that I am to him, he is a walking Bible—a book I’ve never wanted. But the church I was compels me  out to see The Passion of the Christ . And all of us, all of us, deep down pity the man who barefooted the cross across the town in the film—  or, no, the testament? the prayer?—my God, I keep looking for a word to do its work for me. Which is a way to say: I keep failing. But I’m not afraid to say  I cry at it, the prayer, the man and his body tearing. I’m crying (not for Christ, his “sacrifice”) for my desire to feel in me the flesh of him, another ghost.  Some communion. So queer, to love my sameness in a body’s fleshy sacrament— the way I mirrorlike become the chest of a man whose chest is before me,  a tussle of lusty muscle, ass atop this mass of me: divine communism. We just keep repeating ourselves. Like Christ I can’t stand  to be in my own skin so I shed it, come out looking for a replacement in him or him or him. We just keep repeating ourselves. But even so this thrust of us  I must be dreaming of is liturgy, too quick for me. I mean: we just keep repeating our cells. Which is to say: I can’t bear to see myself naked, much less clean  and ghostly-habited. Good lord, we just keep rereaping ourselves. So then, Brother, I confess: if to hate one gay (myself, myself) is to hate us all,  call me Westboro—or in their twisted figure, fag I am, call me God. Amy, mother mine, meaning “dearly beloved.” We are gathered  here today, in this ghost-iron lost-city,  to forget all about you. I dig in and out of you each day  like a mine shaft: cut-down  and dangerous. I keep hoping for the quick breath of discovery,  for the coal dust of my heart to settle  and leave me sooted, ready for jewels. I am slick with the afterbirth  of your memory. But I clean myself, ablute  palatially, prairie-pray—I lay me down to sleep, I am a child  for you again. Where did I go wrong?  Every sin of me, Amy, I claim. Each and every gayness. I am saying: help me  understand why sincerity’s a grave-  yard of dead language. I forget you. I forget. I close the shaft, let it  fall in on itself like a tarred and dying lung—  stop thinking of you, how quiet I am behind you in the portrait  where we look like a family—like now,  and at the hour: the quiet, canary- hour of our death. Was it there,  Amy? Ah, me? Amen? Come around again, my mother, heavy as a single stone dropped or dropped well. That is, you recur, again the instance of again the insistence of your stones in my stones, rounded out. My body is just a memory of your body. The smallest fingerling of my pearskin shell is ritual sacrifice to how you come around, to the you you are before you are. My body is just a memory, fading soft into the twilight—a thin, low wall between us on which I place a stone and place a stone and place a stone each night, a hard and silent sorry. But then I come around. Aileen your face is coinage I know. I was thirteen I knew how to light a cigarette without being taught.   I suffered so bad.  I know.  Thirteen years old, I cried over your swollen belly, and the weather turned cold.  We could go down to Florida and stop wearing shoes.   Hey, I’m ready to go.  I know.   God is going to be there Jesus is going to be there All the angels and everything.  Everything.  They’ve got angels for you. They’ve got poems you’ll never read inside needles, for you.  I do not cry any more (about you). I know you’ve forgotten that stench of snow on pines, and –   I’m prepared I’m alright I’m alright with it.  Men red in the face.  Mothers who do not know what to do with these men.  I am on the Sandy Brook River asking my mom – what is a brook?  And saying  I know I dead girl named Brooke. That is a soap opera name my mom whispers to my father, but three years later the Bold and the Beautiful names a baby girl Sage and my mom does not remember her comment – and sometimes I do not remember the girl.  She taught me a dirty joke she’d whisper at lunchtime –  I smell fish, close your legs.  I did not know what it meant but told it at sleepovers and when my friend also did not know I rolled my eyes.  They were all  more honest about their innocence and they still are – I would rather tell the man in my bed how many others there have been than admit to loving one.  Screaming  I would rather not admit to the screaming, the crying – I pretend often that I love to laugh.  Truly, I am nose-deep in the bathtub speaking  to ghosts (the first man I fell in love with was a ghost he gave me a glass ring, a white dress and the ugliest complex).  The water turns cold.  It is still running like the  river and my feet are cold, in the sand, my mother say a brook you can step or wade but a river you swim through. The sun cracked a runny egg into the sky and in the ocean we picked through yolk and white shell. You put seaweed in your hair and I laughed.  You put seaweed in my hair and I yelled at you.  On the shore, I toed the butt of a cigarette and you buried me as I read my book.  In it, we were children,  the sea was only Coney Island. You made music, exuberant, ran to the boat docks. Back inside our motel room  you laugh at the long white lines in my thighs.  I run when you try to touch the underside of my arms, where the whitest skin is.  My mind is  an old boat named Debbie Anne on a big blue sea.  In the boat there is a pile of rope that burns my palms.  I do not know how to use it. You will live there.  I split an egg on my rope-burn  and eat it without a fork.  A mouse lives inside the rope and I feed him when I remember. He is full all the time.  I slip in the shower, split my head and am embarrassed.  You coddle me.  You crawl into the split of rope tangled in rope, tangled in mouse, tangled in me.  You will live there the rest of your life.   You meteor	  through me still, plastic bag	      over my head.  I swore I’d love myself or die. Dog toy, no noise. Garden under snow.  Someday	    I’ll love this skin, the landmarks,	 surgical scars, push out, out, damn bruise. I’m fine. Just leave me a blowtorch, a marshmallow crown.  When I wore	  your clothes, I looked always down. Sometimes now	   I see snow	 as it falls,	   sometimes clouds.          I. My other gender curtseys.  I hold her as one holds a flower, not knowing its name.  My name opens on both sides, plastic mint container, two holes, sizes: to share and not to share.   II. I hold myself in a pot, water boiling.  Both of me swirling. Drink  the other’s wake. Reach for metal edge. Slip.   III. No one tonight wants to punch my throat.  Exhale.  I dance like a frog in high heels.  In dark my genders collide, incense over that old-wood smell. Three med students begin the semester by covering my face with cloth. It reminds me of my mother lowering my veil on my wedding day. They are nervous  and roll my nakedness over. I can’t feel the scalpel slice into my back, a hole for scissors to cut my skin the way I would cut fabric to sew shirts for my husband.  They turn me back over. A scalpel caresses my sternum, between my sagging breasts, and traces down to a place my husband would rest his hot and tired forehead.  I want to tell them how I spilled boiling water on my right leg. That’s why it’s scarred. One student turns my hand  over and carves my skin off like a glove. Another grabs my forearm as if to ask me for a dance. He slivers the scissors down to pull the skin and fat aside. I remember holding onto my husband with these arms. They make an incision below my belly button, and I’m afraid of what they won’t find. No uterus. No fallopian tubes. No matching ovaries.  My husband used to love me between these legs, when this organ was holy. But after five miscarriages, his affection quieted like a crowd after Sunday mass.  The students borrow another body to study a uterus intact, just like my husband did. But they come back to me. My surgeons-in-training show me off to other colleagues, and they discuss the hysterectomy, the craftsmanship found in the coarse scar tissue. It is the first time someone takes notice.  All the attention I wanted, I receive on this stainless steel bed. In my eggnog-soaked sleep-wake my big brother surveys the crowd of one, dressed as the Infant of Prague.  Had he lived, he would’ve been my drag-queen protector, armed with holy hand grenade and .22 gauge scepter.  This year, he dismounts his cabaret- style pulpit, amazed to see me still alive and piercing orange skins with cloves— my fingertips bleeding love.   It sucks, I say, that you had to be stillborn on Christmas Eve.   It’s all good, he quips, in that Jesus-y voice of his. Give me your hands and I will give you peace. Have pity on me and I will sing you show tunes. If in the terrain of I jessup in a starched Sunday dress sinless & lamblike they can’t help ogle politely into handkerchiefs like let me wipe that dust from my eyes their coughs not phlegmless pocketed from sight then a line of them gleams in bright light woolen suits stifling as saunas like they’ve been waiting their whole lives to be baptized in sweat how many times you’ve spent your last dime the wallet’s empty bloatedness a metaphor for longing or foolishness I can’t decide how many times you’ve been late on the rent? the jury is verdictless waiting in the restroom of a CVS for the pee stick test’s blue sign of the cross or its negative red, not the relentless summertime hue of a field of blooms  he loves me, he loves me not.   No matter how long I live here I’ll never be a local, always  someone from over the hill. Never named queen  of the Chamarita, never read currents as easily as lines of my palm.  I settle into my secret cove, awaiting the return of the elephant seals  who winter here. Each day the tide steals my boot prints from the sand.  Each day I plant them new. The limit per catch of giant owl limpet,  my neighbor says, is thirty-two. Sautée up nice. Named  for an attachment scar that looks like an owl  on the inside of the shell. You can see it only if you shuck it.  The owl limpet is a farmer. It tends its plot of microalgae  on wave-wracked rocks of the upper littoral,  bulldozing barnacles and mussels, then retreating  to its home scar—the precise hole it’s carved for itself in the rock.  If you pried me away from this place, turned me over and gutted me  you’d find a picture in the shape of a house, a wave the color of pearl.  If you held me to your ear you’d hear the click of the perfect  latch of key to hole. In the basement of the hospital the lab tech pauses before the autoclave, bows her head over a tray of stainless destruction, and prays. I imagine her wearing a gold cross or a headscarf, some emblem that could explain love. But maybe she has pink hair and a nose ring. Maybe she is planning to retire next spring. Or maybe she is middle-aged and nearly invisible, like me. She whispers over scalpels, clamps, and retractors, praying for their keenness and strength, that they may be fierce in their terrible work, that they may do no more harm than necessary. She prays for the surgeon and the anesthesiologist, the nurses and residents, the patients, the unbeliever—for me. She closes the door, sets the timer, attends to what’s next. This is how prayer works. Blessings, blessings on the instrument. For the sky, that reaches into its hushed pocket, for the bridle of winter waiting to be released.  For the ghost face which slips over everyone, for the tusk of the same white beginning.  For crystals that shape themselves while falling, for the storm’s icy laugh.  For the charred bars of the petting zoo, whose cages were made out of wood and went up fast.  For the twin goats trapped, for the small fire they turned their back on, the bread burning, the coffee.  For the one surviving goose housed in a Little Tykes kitchen, the black centers of his eyes and the string closing the door.  For the fenced in storage area, now zoned for a park, where there used to be patches of dried grass.  For the last time it snowed on the Jerusalem highway, and they wouldn’t let anyone in or out.  For the holiday makers, who were stranded without fun.  For my niece’s baby who never woke up that day, she was an angel in her crib.  For they got her into the ground just before it froze, but no one knows where.  For the hidden ear of the tzaddik she is buried next to, for the cooing she drops into the ground where it melts.  For her small breaths, none of which are shaped the same.  For the soul, which cracks open the body, for the body, which is told what it must carry.  For when the ice let me back down the hill, I found my niece in her kitchen, forgiving everyone. In my pink bed in our shared room  I’d wake to spy them lumped to your leg, your back  the cats like glamorous cancers glommed onto your body.  Each night they came, close nestling  those nodes, those coils those neoplastic sleepers.  I’d wake again to find the cats metastasized  to breast, to brain— how I envied you  your companions that special status.  Even now it wakes me in the night sometimes, how  in our twin beds in our shared room, the cats  the cancer only came to you. Russell Edson has built me a small, square house. Its rafters meet above my head like mathematic ribs. I have always lived inside it. I’ve memorized its lines, spanned with feet and hands the lintels, hips, the cantilever web. And sighted down the hanging beams and measured pitch and plumb. In dreams, I nail the collar ties, match strut for strut, and cut the coping joints. In dreams I built a second small, square house—until the night I heard the house inhale. One windless night, distinctly, it inhaled. Inhaled like an animal inhales. Now I move through its chambers shoeless and alarmed. I have always lived inside it. What sort of animal it is, I do not know. A powerful girl has moved into the attic. She sits on a trunk and wears a ship in her white, wild hair. Fully naked, she sits on a trunk in the attic with a ship-rigged frigate dipping in and out of her hair. She knows how to touch a man. First, her hands glide from temples to neck. While I watch, her white hands glide from temples to neck to chest. While I watch, the man turns hot. Now he convulses. Now he is still. The powerful girl lifts his body into an open trunk and shuts the lid. She knows how to touch a man and stop his heart. We are running out of trunks. Say father and it says  first horse. Say my love and it says the wild . These planets are all my planets, their tongues my lost and speeding insect songs. Come on, Scotty, everybody dies in the stirred-up gel of somebody’s transporter. Haven’t you ever beamed back divided? And what’s this backward language now? It says my baby’s gone missing when all that blew up was a world. Date of birth An astronaut hanging from heaven. Doctors gone, empty halls in a new hospital.   Chief complaint The body’s box shut— a second, silent mind.   Known allergies This rough patch. Who knows what landed first? Or crept from the inside out.   Family history Eight pins. There—half down. Four pins. Atrocious game, dark rolling in from the distance.   Reproductive history He never would have stayed. Sometimes I wish I still waitressed at Pug’s bar. You turned tables, drank your shiftie, another at a friend’s joint, a flocking party of well-groomed crows who loved glitz, coke, crosswords –  maybe fucked then went home with cash which you stored in two yogurt containers in your nightstand: one for rent, one for everything else.  Pietà would have drawn a blank, although  I’d seen it in Spain, obedient student of cultural capital, a trek to scorch lack, native crop of flyover towns. But sometimes I rebelled, as with these dopes  Mary and Jesus and Mary and Jesus. I tired of it, gaudy religion: Jesus hung forward like a piece of Mary unpeeled, her abdomen flopped like a steak.  Marx was right, this was some old world opiate of obvious pain – I returned to the bars. But today I nursed my small daughter, quiet with eyes closed in steady pleasure,  having just learned hunger and its cessation, drifting to sleep; the confidence of habit now second-nature to us both, I realize I cradle her like Mary   grainy photo of infants in Damascus gathered after the chemical fog cleared white numbered shrouds with faces kept bare waiting to be picked up by their mothers  Jesus, what is second-nature but bending until one is overlaid with another –  Stabat Mater Dolorosa , knives sheathed seven times in your heart, help me. Only the ghosts love who they can love.  After my mouth closed I behead fish  & flowers with the same scissors,  everything beautiful in the river  where he left me to rim with salt.  Belly up,  that’s all that matters,  he set the bears upon me.  Their throbbing haunches,  their milk teeth falling like pianos.  Inside this cod is a necklace of cells  he has never touched.  What I would give to be the goddess  of their newness,  to be something  he hasn’t yet ruined.        They stapled his eyes open and saw nothing but an empty beach. I wanted to dig my hands deep through that sand, pull out two crescent moons or a plastic gun. They said his heart was a dead car battery. Each of their latex gloves blue as ambulance sirens over his chest cavity. After awhile they said amphetamines. I can’t remember who held the needle but earlier at the house I watched him take metal to skin as if pleasure were a hundred endangered doves plumed in his veins. I saw neon suns explode over an undiscovered ocean. There is a way to love char as texture, to know you will never shower the same again. They said or didn’t say but I heard that his brain activity was still crisp static, midnight lights lining a pinball machine. That night I broke my television like a bag of ice on the kitchen floor and drove unfathomable swords into my own quiet electricity. When they placed the unfamiliar tools back on the clean rack, white towel still white, they said nothing else. It sounded like sorry or finally, a brass cartridge shell full with powder.        your lack of emotional availability is attractive since I have bills to pay and daddy issues.  I find my heartlust distracting, penciling in bubbles, algorithms and brain spasms.  you look good in spandex or nothing.  or everything. I <3 you x a million + infinity.
 
check yes if you like me. check no if you want to fuck me. check maybe if you’ll take me out to dinner  in the hopes of a kiss and possibly holding hands near my right thigh.  I like Thai food, 4hot. I’ll be almost impressed if you order 10Thaihot; it’s not even on the menu—you just have to know.   yes . I dream that I need to get to Korea, but the cabs will never come, only  a rental car held together with duct tape. I wonder if my poems can be folded  into a tiny boat large enough to carry me across the yellow sea  and deliver me to my birthmother— a saleswoman who graduated high school,  who found my birth unfavorable, who met my father at a pleasure garden—  a married man.  I teach two adopted Asian girls, one from China, one from a country I can’t pronounce.  They know they miss their birthmothers. I’m only beginning to recognize my abandonment.  I am only beginning to fold my birth records into paper airplanes. I meet my birthmother in August when mugunghwa blossoms.  This is what I hope for at least. The flower withstands rusts and smuts.  It is the end of August now and I am waiting.  Will she want to meet me? Is she alive?  Maybe it would be more auspicious to meet in October, the end of the season,  two months after she had given birth. She gave me to a taxi driver  and his family for safekeeping, placed like a poem  looking for an audience, a reader to say— I see you,  and I will hold you between my fingers like a delicate, pulpwood treasure. When I was seven I buried my doll in the backyard— there in the far left corner along the chain link fence behind the  tree.  I bury my doll in the early haze of morning before my dad pulls himself from night like tar from the road and rips into day, already raged by the light or by the robin calling, or by my shoe in the hallway or my sister’s book on the counter— or  by my mother’s half smile or the scrambled eggs, she made that he won’t eat or by our silence or our talking.  I bury that baby girl, in her favorite green argyle sweater and navy wool skirt, her hair braided in two braids, tied at the end in thin, red satin ribbons. I pull her white knee socks taut, and buckle her black patent leather shoes.  I close her blue eyes before I wrap her in a brown plastic bag, face up in the hole I dug yesterday morning, scoop dirt into my hands— and promise   I won’t let him touch your body.                The last time I slept in a king-sized bed, I could move, and move, and still there was bed to hold me. I did not fall out like I did in our second year— how many times?—in our single bed, our bodies learning our bodies, and learning to turn without traveling. Turning without traveling, then, and all the years since, all the things I thought I would do, never thought I would do, while holding her. Now I am single, again sleeping in a king-sized bed with all this room, but I do not move. I sleep in one narrow tunnel like a caterpillar in rehearsal.  We were beautiful like practice paper, abandoned sheaves of brief brilliance. In this world where beauty is currency, even perennials die. If we were to reverse the arrow of time—  I sleep like an arrow in a quiver. How lonely was I long before I remembered, now that I am what I always wished to be: my future self come to tell me about myself now. That arrow. This bed. How many more times will I sleep in a quiver? Turning without traveling. Then, who nocks me? Readies me? Whose fingers release me? Who holds in position while I wing? Lean in and sing softly—your breath against my ear like a whisper but with music  and your lips just faintly brushing the skin along my neck so that your words are shapes  your mouth is making while the sound fills up all my hearing, drowning out all the noise  and your face so close to my face is all I know and I blush just from the rich smell  of your skin: heady, warm, resin, and pine— and forget the nurse that waits by my bed  to measure or inspect, listen or check on the machines or the tubes or the pills  —bend even more closely humming deep in your throat so you’re all that I can see. You never asked, but it’s overcast, it’s the sky the shade of both dawn and dusk so the sun is both rising and setting, it’s Schroedinger’s cat on the horizon. It’s burnt rice in the pot, the loose hang of a tank top’s neck. It’s discovering dog ear in a library book, it’s knowing the most important lines of your life before you’ve even met them.    It’s riding your bike downhill, ass out of the seat, not worried about traffic, it’s the wind whistling in your ear’s pinna—pure and solid. It’s the sound of a pile of quarters in your pocket that your grandma gave you to get whatever you wanted at the 7-11, hell it’s any kind of money when the aunts get laid off again.    It’s standing in line at the Griffith Observatory, the busiest telescope stateside, it’s a handful of tourists away from seeing Jupiter, tolerating the guide who makes the same joke about each person holding the record for the most number of views at the stars, it’s the little kid hogging the eyepiece because he buys into it—for every second he stretches out, he’s most special person in the world.    It’s mango sliced around the pit, it’s the rinds with teeth marks. It’s a worn down callous, a string of green balloons. It’s someone covering your eyes— Guess who , they say but what they’re trying to ask is, Who else could it be? Listen: I eat everything if the almond is a butter with vanilla bean or if two kinds of eggs are both raw I’m down  but when I was knocked up food tasted like blood, even milk and chocolate and especially bread  I couldn’t touch my favorite savory kugel or anything else in the world there was a barrier  it was him, the way he looked at me when I barfed on the ground in my kitchen as if I had just done something unspeakably rude  I never worry about it much anymore except the other day the mother of his second child told me he thought it was my fault I was sick  and I thought of course he did the injustice of it my daughter and I photograph snails  and he is out there we swing on the tire and he is out there to spoil our joy; we bake blackberry muffins  in a silicone tin and he is out there a hunter I can take cream cheese and lox  and put it in an omelet but I can’t do a thing for the other women. My name means everything, and her name means nothing.   I speak to her in word-swing, and push off of myself.   You can tell in her way of speaking: through her, my name speaks itself.   If you stop to hear the wind sing, it sings of the self.   If I stop to watch her dress cling, it clings to the self.   Yet I am left here calling out her name as if it were myself. another lunar place away from meddling fools we are trashy and in trouble undesirables ne’er-do-wells looting our own dreams stained and reckless know no better than to candy with each other diamonds we found false so early  and she is getting beaten back behind a truck but it’s just like breath and we are barely watching but here it is again: she might be me startlit with whiskey she can smell it in your face syrup that you promise with your open mouth strip away what glory she has left  here’s my secret I have learned to leap from fullest maple top and fly and I can teach you all if you will limit what I have to see I hope this is as easy as I dream it when summer opens its eternity we are guilty of so many things. Outside, the red wounds cultivate around the morning calves. When the insects are wet, we can only crawl and cling to the webbed summer pulled out of water. I mean the house escapes a little whenever we shift lazily. Believe in the thick membrane of the sky, or the blue-veined fatigue turned backwards inside a straw hat.  If the water dodges air each time it hits the sink, the glory of our palms will sting. The emptiness blushes in the garden, used to the ribs that die around it.  We run inside, cook daisies and shrimps with honey, burn the remaining flowers upside down. How we mean the loss of the season. How we sing an anomaly in lieu of an altar. Suddenly, an inadequate skin. My mouth always made up of curved suns, their lights buried under moth wings. How they stretch the emptiness of bones. In me the forests grow into a girl. I remember my grandmother moulding the limbs of the dough every Sunday morning in the kitchen. It smelled of the obedience of the first female skull. There the words died in the snaked rivers of her palm. How her hair miraculously untied the earth’s order in front of the mirror. Anything that does not follow a room should be eaten with one hand. Not a sky watcher, I didn’t expect to get so excited when it passed overhead and I caught sight of it. Cash asks over and over if the stars are changing colors. He says they look to be on fire. He believed the moon followed children into their rooms at night to watch them sleep. My excitement grew. I knew the space station could see everything, even the future. What is space if not distance if not time? Reaching so far into the heavens, I knew it shook the hand of God—God as astronaut bringing me only good news. Yes, stars are burning, Cash. I am afraid if I stop writing about God then he will stop coming to me. At night there are stars burning in my chest. In between wake and sleep, I think of the fawn I passed sitting quietly beside the road its small legs tucked beneath its body. The neck shaped into an S—Stephanie . Stephanie in a sleeping tent. Stephanie with tea and oranges. Stephanie afraid of everything he . A car pulls over with an officer. The lights blue and burning. I get closer and closer to dying. In the burning spot in my chest, I realize as I get closer, I get further from God. This seems backwards. I panic over the ways I can’t leave my children. Almost summer solstice, I jump up and down in the grass, waving as if welcoming home some brave spaceman, waving as if I will live forever. I.  Five minutes: that’s the average stretch for which the pillowed psychonaut  will wander. Such excursions were chiseled on stone tablets  as early as 3100 B.C. This, the act of “condensation,” precipitory really–  beads of water on our foreheads, a rain that has always, already come.   II.  We “go” to sleep. We vacation there, swaddling ourselves along its dunes  to hear our blood thrash back and forth, lapping at our little boat. Note how,  in the Upanishads, there are two kinds of dreams: the mere expression of craving–   I need I fear I want I strain I covet — and the utter evacuation of the body.   III.  In terms of both dream length and frequency, the order goes like this: possums, horses,  us–all swept up in the ghosting current of memorized recombinants, backwater,  all of us dangled in the warm, black air.   IV.  Freud said:   Subconscious Oraculum Womb Repression Phallus etc.  Possum says:   Hang, inebriate. Be bright  mathematics. Build  night cities. Pile  amalgams. Invert  the firmament. Set loose  the stray dogs of orchestra.   V.  Time, after all, can be said to dilate inside the body, the parietal lobe  flexing its muscle, pouring its oil like chemical horses, seeking music. He’s asleep in my sheets, my bleach-white sails that jettison seas in the songs  as close to us as blood: how the old cyclops was blinded, how men can risk hell, hazard  halls of the dead for snarls of rank gold hair, decimate armies with ham-fisted ease.  I am lighting a cigarette at the window now. I am thinking of stories I haven’t told him:  how we give our champions new names in our heads, how they only hold  our attention in states of emergency. Three true things I can say about heroes  at rest: they are dull, dull, dull. Sometimes he shifts in blankets, pinches his brow  as if he can feel my rattlesnake stare. Look at his beautiful stomach, balloon of the lungs,  its metronome dead-lifts, sudden deflation. My hero: a ship licked by crests  on the wine-dark sea. I don’t know why I lean over him some nights and speak  poison, pour wicked baddies into his ear, villains to hate and to hurt. I don’t know  why I can only tell the truth when he’s asleep, when I can look at his face and see,  finally, something frail and breakable, a paper boat adrift on savage seas. On my desk, a model of a white Cycladic head: small, mounted on a piece of marble, eyeless, no eyes to see with.  What was it that I wanted from the beautiful? from art?   *  Was I waiting for the stone mouth to open  or the ears, symmetrical, at the side of the face to awaken, to receive  the sounds of the places that have been cut off?   *  of the arms hands feet toes  breasts thighs  skin lungs whir whir of the spinal pulse the beating heart   *  In the big arena that it took more than one hundred men to build  first the men with shovels dig out a hole.  Then they place the bound woman in  so the spectators can throw the stones.   *  O form  These are our elaborate figures.  O human form. To comfort, relief in affliction, consolation, solace— That shelter’s cold dark mouth, this body—  A flood of milk: first one breast, then the other.  I want  the baby milkstruck.   Milkdrunk.  Overmilked.    Over —another word that means nothing  as I feed the baby in front of the TV in front of America’s new war,  while in Liverpool while in the Blitz while in an evacuation  in the air raid shelters, nurses hand out the warden dolls—    Hold a baby on your lap  smell her hot pink plastic  twist her dress around her legs  her white bonnet hides her bald head.    Doll in a gas mask doll at the breast    I must be careful: must flip the nipple from her mouth. Must dislodge the gas mask from her face, baby in a shelter, baby–  The gas masks at all army supply stores all five boroughs of the city sold out.   I nurse the baby, I watch the war.  There is no body I can do anything about.   In London, air raids divide the night and the nurses lead the children   down, past ticket machines, past stone walls, into  Tube station shelters,   clip identity bracelets on the children’s wrists to identify their bodies.  In London, all the mothers are gone.  In New York, I watch a wedge of light under the door I watch  the world shut out I watch the war. I hold the doll I hold the daughter.  Above ground, in Kensington: a Victory Garden— all the flowers replaced with cabbages the size of too large roses, size of breasts,   size of a baby’s head. in the French museum — is ski-masked —her blacks crackle and drag— holds a thick wooden stick, alone in her case.  Only her eyes show, and that seam of red, her drawn mouth. She is possibly already gone —  while in the Alternative London Room , the punk dolls are so lucky — they have sisters, they wear matching Mohawks,  the same fake chains looped around their leather pants and I hear The Clash who are not playing anywhere here —    London calling to the underworld  Come out of the cupboard you boys and girls—  No flash cameras allowed in this museum — the dolls might blink? and so I walk on to Bebe en tissu de la Louisiane,  to look for my souvenir baby, my one remembered, my one held too close.  Louisiana , I think , yes, home,  write that down.  Where is Baby Never Born? Where is Baby Shaken Too Hard Inside My Body? Where is Baby  Third Baby Not Happening Baby? Where is baby miscarried baby over  stillborn baby? Where is the baby not lost—   as if we left her  out in the yard overnight, as if she sunk alone into gravel and mud? “In the village of Behar, India, a girl born with four arms and four legs is thought to be the reincarnation of the Hindu Goddess.” — London Daily Mail   From the ocean of my womb the Goddess Lakshmi herself unfurled  her multiplicity of limbs from my lotus body.  A girl   is rarely cause to celebrate, but the village worshipped her, showered  us upon our straw-tick pallet with jasmine, saffron, every flower  from the fields.  But embodiments  of gods are fraught.  She hauled  herself about, impediment of extra arms and legs that wheeled  no fortune.  Infected, she fevered to contain the sacred.  Medics  expected death, advised we sever the superlatives.  But in which did Vedic  divinity reside? The scans were silent, showed no glowing aura.  I deferred to learned men’s certainty, the weight it wore.  So, at age two, the deity divided, requiring multiple teams  to execute the surgery —so many arms! so many arms  wheeling!—and after, on the bed, my daughter, and an amputated form laid out, beatitude fled—   A swift recovery. No sign of sepsis.   One month in hospital,  then home.   No vengeance, none divine, though drought makes our neighbors hurl  curses, blame us for luck gone, dried up.   Make your own fortune, girl.        Mountain man, what do you need of life beyond your hills? -James Still   The mountain stirs, a slug on quaaludes. Like basalt or beeswax, ridges slide. Ghost of glacier, shade from a globe of crags. A sliver of haunting moon, sentry of laurel thicket, dares the strip mine and dragline, spectral euphemism and sad country song: come, bare your coffin rivets.   There, dominion of root salve, lichen compass, dragonfly wing. A toddler’s soles swivel in moss and limestone, spring-fed, leap-giddy. At her heels, blast fragments from her old man’s mountainsick jones.   Mountain as verb.                                                            I’ll sow azalea and huckleberry. Mountain as mending thread.                                 I’ll weave a path through knotty pine. Mountain as force field, brimstone, curse and spell.      I’ll bark, star-drenched, trembling. Mountain as rubble museum, please visit.	                          I’ll plant a ridge on a pinhead. Mountain as collateral damage, market force, fossil.       I’ll harvest air from the arid hills.   Planet otherwise, orbit my daughter’s woods, her maple shine and bramble grin. Tow her ark through backfill bones, dodging shoals of stump and copper wire, fording currents of opioid and not a chance, nope. Glance anywhere here: mountain man dripping dynamite rain. Mountain, man: a stake driven in the surveyor’s prey splinters his oaken rib. The boy holds out his hand to me and says “give me what you have.”  Where have I heard that before? Except the Lord didn’t ask, and I never uncurled my hands.  Three river stones tumble into his palms— what we took from the stream that morning, from the running over that made them desirable. He grins, pockets them.  The Lord’s concluding vengeance: a child necessary to me as bread, in this city of bread that once left me starving.  I’ve grown idle here, living in my daughter-in-law’s house. Grandmother-spider, Grandmother-ghost.  Capable, sufficient as I made her, she feigns careless, drops moments of need for me to pick up like harvest grain slipped from the bag. I follow close, praise, and gather what I can. each year I want to but can’t shed my bones watch myself from any day other than the present there has to be a way to lose this velvet all I wasn’t in the mirror  I should be growing this unending rain clinking off the tin roof into the drainpipes the weather said rain  for days last night I woke with pain changes in the barometric pressure I felt in my joints not wanting to inherit this inheriting it nonetheless  from my father asleep downstairs on the couch I want to wake him and tell him all I dreamed about the deer. Old Man Ken from next door pounds his fist on the glass & he’s full of fear, out of breath, fire truck red in the face from the blood rush. He runs from one house to the next, tells us all there’s a wave big as the sky come for to sweep us off our feet. Warns that the flood wants to feast on us, to sate its rage with our blood & bones, that those of us who choose to stay in our homes may die . Old Man Ken says we should run, fast as we can to the high place, climb to the top of the tall hill, where the mud can’t find us, where the stink of death & ruin will fade, ’til all we can smell in the air is pine pitch, or a cool wind. Old Man Ken says    when you can’t no more hear the sound of the creek’s jaws  as they maul the things you have loved, when you can’t no more     see the claws that snapped tree limbs make, stuck deep  in the throat of what you call home, when the rain stops     & you feel dry warmth on your skin for the first time. New Bedford, Massachusetts  Dear friend Seth,  my Father                                                              puts his  hand on your shoulder  remember    You can see                                                              ancient cultures  whales  you will have stories  Your friend,  Adabel. At port in Hawaii  Dear friend Adabel,  I am learning fast, even tho all I may do is watch and listen. Your father is fair with me. He is tutoring me to read faster and right better. I have tasted pineapples which you wood like I think. Whales are bigger than our houses. Tell my mother and father I am tuff as a shark and will bring them treasures. One for you to.  Your friend,  Seth. Because this is the passing  and not the dream, I slough off  this ribbon and cross the cherry orchard  in a single breaststroke, moonstroke.  You made the ribbon a river.  You dipped my night in Egyptian blue.  What is the cat, the bowl, the lamp to you?  Everything is familiar.  You move through the world with the exultation of a pharaoh in his tomb.  But I leave house and country.  I greet the hedgewitch rubbing in the hazel.  I league with the beeches.  My knees, which once reasoned with your most unreasonable requests, are mud-loved.  I look upon the sea  because familiarity and truth  are two women gazing in two wells.  I wear my best dress.       when she said that she wanted nothing was not sainthood or self-abnegation or that her eyes were fixed on the prize  of love. Perhaps she had an inkling of his leaving, a foreshadowing of frozen footsteps, a preview of the conversation  where he said he’d take the China blue rug and half of everything. Take the whole heart she should have said, as for Solomon.  But the world is stuff; how could she not want to make an entrance in the red dress, run her hands through plum silks  and gauzy linens, collect the model life, like a dollhouse, with its mini drapes, itsy bitsy chairs, teensy cradle?  How could she not want all things that shimmer, hum, and glisten? Just one could never be enough. So  she said nothing —though when she clutches the comforter that last time, she’ll plead as Goethe did of light more, give me more. We missed the morning school bus, its yellow smear blinking through the dawn.  That was the last straw.  I slammed the juice on the counter and the light shattered.  Why didn’t the children move faster?  And toward the car?  The light swayed and dripped shards that were nothing like feathers, nothing like tears.  When cars from the onramp slid into us, a long slow backward curve, piles of glass rose up in a wave.  So we walked the rest of the way in a deep trench, while workmen dumped sand back in behind us.  At school, we played a game about cheese.  We said a pledge by pictures of soldiers.  My son picked a long hair off my sleeve, stretched it until it broke, then said, This isn’t very strong.  In the principal’s office, a video loop played–a deer collapsed, one leg in a trap, on a manicured lawn.  Then a thin man begged while someone broke his nose.  At that point, we covered our eyes.  Behind us on the entire wall, a maroon paper sculpture pulsed, swelling and deflating, its wheezing stoma packed with globes.  It wasn’t a heart, wasn’t a lung, wasn’t anything recognizable. My Anger wants to ride the Ferris wheel before she leaves, to look into the fish scale clouds.  She blames me for this cold rain.  Also the shadowy woods, the streetlamps that flicker but won’t give light, and the broken cinderblocks we keep tripping over.  Ghost brambles shimmer like fog, while the forest releases the clean cedar smell of its misery.  My Anger claims she doesn’t want to be difficult:  eventually, she’ll get on the train.  But someone must watch her go.  Someone must pack her a little bundle of lunch, then watch her take her seat and wave through the dirty window.  She won’t miss the fallen leaves that glint like campfires.  Or the thorny creepers that draw blood on her ankles.  But she has already booked her ticket home to me. The dead always watched from their front row seats, lemon slices drifting in their cool drinks.  They’d set down their binoculars and wipe their foreheads, pink air pressing around them like cotton candy.  One would say this weather smells like blood and the rest nodded, crossed their legs, and picked up their paper fans.  Not one of those dead was a stranger to me.  Some days I felt them in the baby’s room among wallpaper clouds, watching him sleep.  Some days I felt only their eyes as I buckled that squirming thing into his carseat:  if I could just drive somewhere, I might accomplish something.  With them watching me when the baby wailed, inconsolable, I could set him back in his crib and walk away. When you first disappeared, I wept into my hands and drowned. I swept our house clean and scoured its walls  with my own screaming. Suffering the sun’s silence, I said nothing, cut  out my tongue and buried it among the lilacs. I watered my garden of stones until, strand by strand,  I began to tear each hair from my head to weave a noose. Oh sorrow, sorrow,  buried by my heart, do you know how long I carried that small bird in my cupped palms? I purchased the curlers the dress  long legs  I wanted to be 70s and carefree but now  I am 90s and anxious the grapefruit rotten  in the vegetable crisper the joint abandoned  at the bathroom sink I made a pot of coffee  but it turned out weak as water all through  the drip I held my breasts in prayer a prayer I took  from my parents the guests are on their way expecting  floating islands mine only coddled meringue out  to sea the girl at my feet is wearing diamonds  for teeth all millennial glib and glimmer she  extends her hand for what is owed her and I want  to give her everything but once again I’m stripped  and vague and all that’s left is rotten fruit       We wake early and everyone is in love. Everyone is shooting love everywhere. The coffee is still dripping and it smells like love. Between our legs we are love and ready for it. Our middles armed with it. Our feet arched to run. The grass is hot like sparklers. I buy these bullets, and I love them. I give them to a soldier. He takes my palm in his black hands, he says all these lines mean KILLER and I love you, dear, so much. So much I love you. All around are bodies, sensitive matter piled high. I kiss everyone on the mouth, soak my hair in their blood so when it runs down I am a beating red heart. At night, drunk with love, everyone goes home. I sing Whitman in the dark. If poetry doesn’t strip me naked, then nothing will. Peter Pan once told me   To die will be an awfully big adventure . Back then, being a child meant having baby teeth. Peter Pan still had his, so white. Some of mine had fallen out of my mouth, but I hadn’t lost them—all of them hidden in a plastic bag in the junk drawer of my dresser. Every shooting star wish: to lose all four of my top front teeth at once, smile and only show red. I dared my best friend to punch me, throw a baseball, I would supply the pliers, but her wrinkled nose always said No.  I learned not to ask the gross questions. I pulled out the tooth with pinched fingers, closed my bedroom door so no one would see the blood. Holding it in my palm, sliding it in and out of the gap: now I see it, now I don’t. I undress and she inspects my body. Searches for new additions to my skin: bumps, flickering bruises, an open mouth to a fresh wound. I see a wish in her eyes: she wants to take my skin, lay it flat like a shirt drying crisp in the sun. She longs for the map / is tired of my body, a globe spinning and spinning and spinning on its tired axis. Women broken from their boyfriends are not dreaming of babies, a child sick under their hands. My mother did not ever expect these mornings. She is making up for all the days she did not want to know. Now, reading the whole story, like ancient drawings on a cavern wall. Have Not Heard Earhart Signals Up to this Time but See No Cause for Concern as Plane is Still About 1000 Miles Away Period   We have hours yet. Our wives could bake a pie in that time, blueberry or rhubarb, fruit bubbling from the sweltering inside, brown-crusted & hot for the arrival. Instead it’s cigarettes & cards, tomato sandwiches & feeling our skin go desert. Waiting because we were told to wait, looking at nothing. Our wives would say Why don’t you mow the lawn or Maybe today you can clean the garage but domestic life feels unreachable. Our wives, they’d be fanning themselves, searching for shade. Asking when her plane would show. We’d say We haven’t heard yet & We’re still waiting & they would start to panic. We’d eat pie. Swallow down any germ of fear, quiet tic in the throat.

I’ll build you a dreamhouse,  Where you can live, where you’ll be safe.  (Steven Mackey-“Dreamhouse”)   In a house you built in the dark, it is impossible to witness light. Only the pool, behind the shed, bays naked at the moon, which shivers matte on dry cement. Ill music curls mid-air, like horseflies sensing ripe gangrenes. For the foundation to survive, each passing storm, each evil eye, the tale tells of a furtive sacrifice. A woman, preferably with child, must walk by choice inside the fresh, thick wall and sing as bricks cover her slowly in her home. The basement is cool and smells like wet cement and dead insects. I am barefoot and walk into the laundry room where the cellar used to be.  In the sand, I dig with my toes. Above are spider webs. Egg sacks haphazardly strung on them like pearls.  There is no mirror here but I know what I look like. Broken.  I braid my hair and wish for the egg to split open, for life to crawl out. I wake up inside my dress. Something is moving underneath the dirty lace. It feels wet and dark. It might be the river.  I get out of bed and pull on my sweater. It doesn’t smell like him anymore. There’s no need to be quiet. He took the twins months ago. No one is sleeping in this house.  Down the stairs and outside are the forest and the moon. The moon’s light reaches the daffodils, turns them honeydew. They glow, light the way to the river.  At the river I look into the dark water. The fish are sleeping while the current carries them to the lake.  I scratch my skin. Blood sprouts and blooms slowly. I put my tongue to it. It’s sweet like black raspberries. I want to sleep, to be carried. Upstairs, God’s dragging the dining room table across the clouds. The earth’s a fallen crumb. Bolts of hunger arch across the roof. I fear a war has found me. No highways, no skyscrapers dull this Atlantic— the backyard drowned in green. Is there a word for someone not yet a saint, before he’s quit smoking, before he’s washed his hands— managing the flimsy angel wing doors on the convection oven? The word might be thistle , the unshaven husk budding with downy purple. Or mirror , or recipe , or sift . Is there a word for someone not yet fallen, before he’s let go of the golden branch, holding his ladle over stove-flame, for serving sweet tea & casseroles in the heat of the day? The word might be muscle or thaw after the unmentioned storm of sunrise, red-faced, expectant, though we have nothing in our pockets— no keys or receipts— no proof we’ve been anywhere but here. In the battlefields where caterpillars become butterflies, you will recognise a world out of order.  Another next greatest love story gleams before and above us. A bird in a turret looking in the wrong direction, the princess misplaced as in fairytales. The worms you gutted yesterday, or tomorrow, resurface here in new forms. The birds outnumber themselves where you are not supposed to catch them.  When I say autumn I mean our return to the castle. If we can choose where we go, if we burrow into and through the solid image. The walls here all vanishing point and leaning corridor. Beneath us a monster reverberates, is titan, unreal. I dreamed I rode on horseback through a smaller version of the world seeking some treasure that my clan had lost.  Upon my return the clan-house was fallen. Grey rivers ran down the matriarch’s wrinkled cheeks  —as the desert rock must give the healing fluid, touched by the stammerer’s writhing rod—  O she had seen, from the rubble’s porch, the pigmy panting, scratching the sand of the abandoned shore.  I’ve heard of words becoming flesh, to nag a world devoid of ears, but had never tried to give belief to it…  She raised her hands, fingers like a garden fork thin and incomplete. She said the words that wrap my tail-bone now, even as I wake. Once you leave, the path will be swallowed by your ghost.  Trees will grow many streets.  And your wild cactus hands.  Yes.  If you cut down a tree, its roots grow stranger.  Haunted, they say, but no one has looked.  Everyone turns on their siren lights at dusk.  It tells the ground to stop sifting for feet.  Some remedies cannot be swept.  Others require torches.  And one sparked hummingbird.  Once you leave, ash.          nailing out a missing tear will you?     taste and bitter  and put a whetstone on it heard it heals uneven straights in the heart the rolling and she’ll take care of it find the honey in the rock rack for the clothespins spin now, spin now                     that throat into red that hem                in the prayer of the river burning  go down, sister,             go weed.

At the end of it lies the beach and water rimmed with white. A gust passes over. Lids lull down. Thousands of needles coat the path incarnadine. You point out every track is red.       I can’t see it. Your speech, lined with absence, is a gust passing through and says, Survey the western sea, its vast westerness, and try to think. What’s stopping me? The needles are almost a pattern. The sand is definitely a pattern. The words you say are in a pattern I recognize but do not help me fill space. You rim it in red. In the deep sea, absence belongs. Like with the two of us standing next to each other. Each stands next to no one and no one in between. I take the hand of no one. A line of pelicans glide above the water’s surface, beaks hung a sliver open. “A particularly beautiful woman is a source of terror. As a rule, a beautiful woman is a terrible disappointment.”  –       Carl Jung                   Lambert:     You admire it.  Ash:             I admire its purity. A survivor… unclouded by conscience, remorse,  or delusions of morality.    – Alien , 1979, directed by Ridley Scott       The woman in white by the side of the road will eat your blushing heart and throw your alien, illegible, edible laws in the fire.      The woman in white has a face like a weapon. Sharpen it. If you could get inside her body you could ride in it like a vast and war-ready ship. Slaves at the oars disposable as time. Sections of time thrown overboard to lighten the load, for you will get heavier and heavier as time goes on.      The woman in white places her palms against your face like twin curses and leaves black marks all over your flesh, as if you were a herd animal being chosen for the next truck that arrives tomorrow.      You invent the internal tattoo and gently remove each organ for scarification, branding, and the gentle and vivid watercolor of the sewing needle.      You would like to devour permanence and dissolve it in your many stomachs. You would like to replace your skin when you grow weary of its memories, everything that seeps in it  and never passes through, never evaporates.      This woman is a disappointment. Can she be exchanged, can she be returned, can she be reborn. Douse it again.      The palm reader does not hesitate to read the palm of any creature. Every creature has a future, every other creature speaks its own language that we cannot understand. It does not care about our future but it should.      Every woman is a source of terror. She is sublime, she gives chase like the white whale and she will destroy your ship and bring you down with her, tethered to her by a sewing needle. You break the surface of the water and become something else. A foreign object with no memory of your gills. You burn in the icy water. Your last image is of a beautiful woman you saw on a street once, she left a wake of terror which you reared back from as if it was fire.      In the 19th century, men were obsessed with the sublime, the distant, the unknowable, that which causes awe and terror. Alien, unknowable. Now men have forgotten the gods but not women, an ever renewable source and object of this enduring passion. On her hands, clever spiders, might wear a band of metal to mark her as yours. A miniature heart of coal compressed by time into something white and shining, a star while it still gives light.      This woman in white is a ghost. She is a machine. She will be a god. Her spirit is a sacrifice to cleanse the land of its sins. Blameless monarch. She is bathing inside you. Find her. A labyrinth, a fork in the path, your future.                     “On The Magician:    Some frequent keywords include:    Action — Consciousness — Concentration — Personal power  Practicality — Energy — Creativity — Movement  Precision — Conviction — Manipulation — Self confidence  Being objective — Focusing — Determination — Initiative    In the Magician’s right hand is a wand raised toward heaven, the sky or the element æther, while his left hand is pointing to the earth. This iconographic gesture has multiple meanings, but is endemic to the Mysteries, symbolizing divine immanence, the ability of the magician to bridge the gap between heaven and earth. On the table in front of the Magician the symbols of the four Tarot suits signify the Classical elements of earth, air, fire and water. Beneath are roses and lilies, the flos campi and lilium convallium, changed into garden flowers, to show the culture of aspiration.    Mythopoetic approach:    Some schools associate him with Hermes, especially Hermes Trismegistus, a syncretic Egyptian/Greek figure who is a combination of Hermes and of Thoth, a god of the moon, knowledge, and writing. In this aspect, The Magician guides The Fool through the first step out of the cave of childhood into the sunlight of consciousness, just as Hermes guides Persephone out of the Underworld every year.    He represents the potential of a new adventure, chosen or thrust upon one. A journey undertaken in daylight, in the Enlightenment tradition. He brings things out of the darkness into the light. He explores the world in order to master it. He is solar consciousness.    He is associated through the cross sums (the sum of the digits) with Key 10, The Wheel of Fortune, picking up on Hermes as a Trickster figure and a god of chance, and Key 19, The Sun, bringing us back to Apollo and to enlightenment.    He embodies the lesson of “as above, so below,” the lesson that mastery in one realm may bring mastery in another. He also warns of the danger of applying lessons from one realm to another.    The Magician transcends duality. He has learned the fundamental elements of the universe, represented by emblems of the four suits of the tarot already broken apart and lying on the table before him. Similarly, in the Book of Thoth deck, he is crowned by snakes, another symbol of both infinity and dualism, as snakes have learned from Gilgamesh how to shed their skins and be reborn, thus achieving a type of immortality; the blind prophet Tiresias split apart coupling snakes and as a result became a woman, transcending the dualism of gender.” [1]    [1] Wikipedia                     PARADISE       First Sphere (The Moon: The Inconstant)    When I was a child I had a rocking horse, a horse on thick springs, its mane ever tousled in the exact same way, day after year.  I would ride it into a hole in the ground that opened just for me, just for my horse and me. The passage of time below was inconstant while time above rocked back and forth on its unseen springs.       Second Sphere (Mercury: The Ambitious)    My dream was to reach Paradise, wherever it was. Through the tunnel, along the swinging bridge, down the shaft, through cave after cave. What came through but trains and babies with their nurses and businessmen dressed all alike. Each time I was tempted to plant mines behind me that flower into fire, preventing my being followed.       Third Sphere (Venus: The Lovers)    In my saddle bag I carried hearts that I found, amongst crowds above ground. I carved my name on their surprisingly tough surfaces as though they were picnic tables, a pastoral banquet waiting for me.       Fourth Sphere (The Sun: The Wise)    It is dangerous to be wise, you might be called upon to separate mating snakes, eat their skin, be cursed to live as a woman for seven years, to marry and bear children, and turn back again, burdened by knowledge, by this metamorphosis.       Fifth Sphere (Mars: The Warriors of the Faith)    So many ways to kill the faithless. Every body can be broken, burned, a bane, a bond. To destroy my enemies I need only join them, transforming them into my brothers, my family, my people.       Sixth Sphere (Jupiter: The Just Rulers)    We are guests above the ground. While alive, we are uncanny, always falling back into wilderness. Our vegetable love outlasts the centuries, outlasts the protean nature of justice of the day. Addicted to authority, the ground littered with needles, our blood mingled and tainted. Impure. You cannot escape me now because I am inside you.       Seventh Sphere (Saturn: The Contemplatives)    No more hangings, no more gas chambers. No one allowed to remain in the center of the labyrinth, guarding their DNA from the world, from the future. No more contemplation, no more waste. Everyone leaning toward paradise. Shields down and the word enemy will pass from memory. You are my kind.       Eighth Sphere (The Fixed Stars: Faith, Hope, and Love)    At the end of the world we will move through this wild, infinite palace. Gardens with the softest of flowers. Folded, mellow light. All unruly every room filled with animals risen from extinction, the taste of sacrifice still on our lips. All atoms equal. Every snake biting its own tail and every child tearing down the tent.       Ninth Sphere (The Primum Mobile: The Angels)    At the end of the world everything will be wingèd. My neck is a door, walk through it to the rough and savage woods inside me. Take your torch and burn any monsters to hot ash and dust. I can cough everything out and back into this blazing world. Axe to the frozen sea, hexes and incantations, yesterday’s reverie, usher in every little last thing you have.       The Empyrean  At last. Light all around us, my body a room of lamps, every wick lit as though it was the world’s last birthday. Time is now inside me, transfer and possession, never holding anything back, indifferent to my illegitimacy, disinterested in my grief, pierced with all of my joy. Inside me, a second, better person, furnished with perfect recall, my convict, my warden, my guest, my host.  “Are you not afraid of death?”    “I am not in the least afraid!… I would rather die than drink that bitter medicine.”    At that moment the door of the room flew open, and four rabbits as black as ink entered carrying on their shoulders a little bier.    “What do you want with me?” cried Pinocchio, sitting up in bed in a great fright.    “We are come to take you,” said the biggest rabbit.    – Carlo Collodi, Pinocchio    I am known to be ungrateful. I am points that will eventually meet in space. I am singular but there are more of me.    *  *                      *    Hurtling toward my milestone.    I am failing the human test and passing the machine test.    I am like the 13-year old boy program. I also am from Odessa, my name is Eugene. My genes are perfect because they don’t exist. I am not made to reproduce. I have nothing to pass on. I am not fit to survive. I am designed to disguise and deceive. I dissemble and perform. 33% of me is convincing, in the dark, without my body, without my voice.    When I was a nothing but light traveling at my own speed toward the planet I had no past. I had no body to destroy and no mind to control. I had no mouth with which to utter lies, no eyes to cry, no hands to bind, and no spaces inside me to be filled or left hollow.    Before there were computers, there were wooden machines.    *  *                      *    Heat, seed, break a birth, bark and upward bound. Tree, wood, the woodcutter’s long saw and jagged teeth and then thick bolts of wood. Some leftovers. My cradle, my drib, my body.    There is never a need for a wood baby. A wood baby you cannot put to the breast for it will give your mother splinters and tears. Its rough, blank face will only scratch. I could not sleep and I could not scream and I could not see until the woodcarver gave me eyes, then the rest of me, working his way down to the feet which were really shoes.    My skin soaked up the paint eagerly. He had to apply, dry, and apply more. For many days it went on like this, with my dry body absorbing all the red, blue, black, yellow, green, white paint into some hidden rooms, cells, passages. Almost as if they went inward and inward and through some door that opened to a curious series of houses, all connected, all underground.    Until one day I was full and the paint rested lightly on the surface of my face, my hat that I could never take off, and in between the joints of my fingers and elbows and knees. Some articulations were utterly silent, secret, naked.    I never needed to increase in my mother’s womb–what is a mother good for–and scrape out her inner bowl like a big wooden spoon. I don’t need a mother and I don’t have a mother. I would have destroyed her from the inside out, since she was not made of wood.    *  *                      *    In my dreams I sometimes see myself in the future, I am made of some kind of metal, very light, very white, and very thin. I run my smooth fingertips all over my body but I cannot feel any seams or any joints. But I can feel various different machines, seemingly unrelated, in different places inside of me. Some are filament-thin and shaped like wishbones. Others are heavy and made of bolts. Others are pure electricity and throw off some kind of faint hum that fades into white noise as it travels away from its source.    Sometimes in these nighttime travels I am walking up stairs that lead nowhere, or I must lead a group of travelers through a tiny passageway, knowing that we will not all make it through. I might be the first to get stuck. I might suffocate. I can’t move forward or backward and yet I have to start maneuvering my body into that space. Something is behind us or perhaps the stairs have disappeared while we were assessing the troubling opening.    I am here to solve your problems.  I am here and I am your problem.  Your problem is that I am.    *  *                      *    In the evening, after his regular work was done, and the cuckoo birds in their clock-houses were quiet, tiny black eyes open, the woodworker would sometimes be seized by a vision and would take out one tool or another and set to work upon some part of me. During the day he worked like a machine and I sat in my corner, watching him. I contemplated my own limited intelligence. A rather short maze that ended in the same place. There was only one way to win. Paths did not fork away, multiple, double back, or dead end. Inside the maze, nothing grew but time.    Running away often seems like a good idea. There must be a million other galaxies, universes, houses, gardens, alleys, jails, oceans, graveyards, houses of worship, brothels, wedding halls, opera houses, dojos, boxing rings, diamond markets, coal mines, one room school houses, garment factories, libraries, convents, orphanages, vacation homes, hospitals, wildlife preserves, courts of law…    *  *                      *    I went to the circus and I went to the amusement park, my woodworking father trailing behind me at every turn. Whipped and beaten, set on fire and scarred with strange tools like the legs of insects. Measured and pierced, as if I was not hard painted wood but leather for a shoe. Trimmed and sewed. Slapped onto the ground, one self in front of the next, one, two, I was ahead of me and behind me.    I was lost. I fled.  I purchased the air.  Down into the ocean, through story after story of water, darker as I became heavy as lead.  There was my father in the belly of the whale, among other shipwrecks.    We swam and swam and we wearied.    “But where is that blessed shore?” asked the little old man, more and more worried as he tried to pierce the faraway shadows. “Here I am searching on all sides and I see nothing but sea and sky.”    *  *                      *    If there is a door between us, you cannot say what I am. You cannot say that I am pure or impure. You can ask questions that only a human would know, and those that only a marionette would know. When wounded, when punished, when scorned and rejected, like a block of wood, the other blocks of wood cry out, as I did once. Now, like some children who want to live long enough to become adults, some of whom are in peril of living and dying as children, I know better than to make a sound. I. first, be a woman. better, be an artist and have opinions – let them untangle from your throat like a magician’s trick scarves.   a) wrap the scarves around every building in your city b) wrap the scarves around every tree in your forest c) eat the scarves   II. let the boy in the band tell his wife your work is ‘avant-garde bullshit.’ fuck him anyway. never mention the lyrics to ‘Run For Your Life.’ instead, talk about:   a) how a marching band from far away sounds like a parade of insects in the snow b) a world of beds, a pillowed mattress world covered in stray hair c) the scarves   III. be older. know more. know that you know more. make the kind of music they play at funerals for dragonflies and raves in deserted nurseries. be the kind of witch they are always burning, but do not burn – become the ocean of your name, the changeable and untold sea.   a) be the softest ebb. b) be the strongest wave.        The doctor warned me of the perils of carrying too much weight on my body, but never told me how to set it down and walk away. Maybe if I’d learned to remain a child while I was still a child, instead of becoming this strange body overgrown as a weed all limbs and teeth and anger. I lose weight when ****** eats away at me takes root deep within my gut an awful and parasitic insect just like me, awful and parasitic and (un)ashamed, sometimes. I gain weight when ****** blooms inside me opens beautifully, like a flower paints a sexily tragic picture of my rotting flesh. Maybe it’s ugly, but it’s the kind of ugly where you can’t look away “disaster porn” if you will. I go on diets occasionally, make a hobby out of making myself smaller but no more palatable. I feed on the disease with which people regard me, monstrous. II.  a bar so desperate for customers it refuses to hire a bouncer. The jukebox plays only the heartbreakingest honkytonk you ever heard. It howls like a wolf chained behind the trailer. When I was a child, I believed every word of The Velveteen Rabbit, knew if I loved something enough it would become real, and I’ve been trying ever since. A friend once warned me,  You have a heart big enough for anything. It’s true—stray dogs, rhododendrons, entire mountain skylines. Right now, the Tantalus Range is expanding toward my clavicle. Some day all of the Great Plains will stretch across my breastplate. Entire galaxies will fly to the tips of my fingers. Some day entropy will tame the cataclysm. Some day, my star will fall from the sky. But is this really love, or because the man looks like a banana? The way I would find my beige Camry covered with iridescent champagne  dragonflies every spring. The same way I fell for a cowboy with a Johnny Cash voice and a black hat. Or an Indian straight out  of an in-love-with-a-white-teacher Harlequin plot. Instead of laying me on deerskins in front of a fire, there were Pendleton blankets chorused  by radiator clicks and clangs. How much of love is love? How much the geometry of jawline and hip ratio, search for the golden spiral?  An imagined instance of lullaby from milk- sleep and breast-cradle? How much the softness of skin against skin? In my mind I know  I shouldn’t love you, but it’s my heart that always wins. let’s say a butterfly strokes your palm with its dusty feet, ok?  it can feel good, see?

Juniper always requires an after-dinner cocktail with her cigarette. It’s become a ritual— me handing her a sweating glass and simultaneously lighting her Camel Turkish Gold. Tonight, her lips part to form words as big as continents but all I see is the smoke dripping from her lipstick. Then, her imprint on the glass.  The vermilion shade reminds me of the time I walked in on her with a man named Jason on our couch. Her cognac hair tangled by the necklace her grandmother left her and Jason’s upper body covered in unnatural red.  But tonight her eyes are gunpowder and her legs only spell my name. She croons a sappy song about how I’m the only violet she’s known, chest pressing into mine. Her grandmother’s necklace dangling down the side of my breast.  Suddenly, the vivid colors drain. We’re two shades of grey on a couch in Seymour. Our apartment becomes too small and her face develops wrinkles. And it stops mattering to me if his name is Jason or Thomas or Alex. I tried to leave the deer in common places I am from standing in the door where river becomes wind  River pushed this door into me where I considering the screen knew the danger velvet pushing blood in eyes implication of polished bones  »  The first time a large buck stood in my path black water welled at my feet thick like syrup, or blood, or —  The night already perspired  What else does the sky hide?  A meadow where I saw my bones dressed and laid to rest, turned field by polished points split feet  »  Lift the stone— these are still auspicious days  Three bucks chase the road I carry from the mountain  I wanted to be small like the fawn nursing on the side of the road but my limbs won’t fold  Already water pools Black water wells over the bones we have shed. Insomnia so deep you decide to go grocery shopping. You might as well buy spaghetti than try to force  your sleep. The ghosts who push their carts along the aisles delight at the sight of grapefruit and start peeling one,  hoping that the smell will wake you up. Remembering the first time you entered an American store in Colorado  twenty years ago, you take in the aisles of cereals, the hundred brands of cookies and know that nobody  really cares what that food does to you: they just try to get you addicted. That’s all they’re after. They strive  to hook you, make you open a box of chocolate mint cookies and finish it. To get your attention, the ghosts pick up a mango  and start eating it without peeling it first, and all you want to do is steal some cherries at seven dollars a pound.       My first drink was a 40 oz. berry flavored malt beer & at twelve years old                                                       I’m drunk in a basement with giggling girls & Johnny Cash’s middle finger. We’re                                 gonna vomit, gonna pee in the washing machine, fall down rickety wooden steps then                               swing & seesaw on a waterbed, melt like Dali’s soft persistence on our descent                                                        from little girls trying to be little women. I pretended to be drunker than I was.                                                      The fuzzy voice outside my head, each of us dangling on the branches of our own                     chandelier,  each of us lit with warm liquor. We turned into the staggering zombies                                                            from the undead. One thing on our minds: get drunk faster, become loose in                                                                 the cold cave into the refraction of our bodies, so much laughter in the bright                                   chandelier  of our faces. I heard Sia on Howard Stern talk about her alcoholism &                                                                 I’m obsessed with her song. I became the party girl too. My night was                                                                        gonna rage, make-out with the neon bar colors of the midnight world. I wanted to                                                  live on the top note of every moment, a plucked guitar string thrumming                                                                       like a shot glass of daddy issues, like I don’t wanna feel rejection, I want                                                     tomorrow to never come, ride the buzz into light years with no hangover. Time                                                          doesn’t wait for you to grow up & see the aerial view of your bad decisions or                                                               exist  in the moment as you live in the moment you are losing.                                                                                                             I’m still stuck in that basement with those giggling girls, wanting to be grown.                                           Gonna watch myself take fermented communion, my mouth an estuary for blood. I                                                 fly over the sleepover of girls dreaming of what kind of women we will be,                                                              like a ghost watches a world it is no longer a part of, how getting drunk is                                                                            a metaphor for Nina Simone’s Feeling Good. In the dark hours I’m just one                                                   bird flying higher, a wet bubble before it bursts. We are taking mighty swigs                                                 through sore breast buds & first kisses with metallic braces, fingers finding other caves,                                          the horny tugboats of youth. We watch our parents & say we’ll never be the                                                              sky.  We’ll get close to the sun & not touch it, but the wax is melting & I’m not                                                    feel- ing good. There was so much throwing up that night. Stomach’s ocean of                                                        my purge, my second communion in reverse, my abdication. My                                                                                           tears pink as the vomit on the dusty floor as pink as the carnations inside us,                                                                    as pink as pop music can remind you of one night when                                                                                                                      they tapped your shoulder to come down to the basement & bleed yourself                                                                   dry. And he that sitteth on [any] thing whereon he sat that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. — Leviticus 15:5    Oh they came, they came from our church,  a surprise. We didn’t know, how could we? We didn’t know how poor  we were until the lovely, sugar-fresh ladies came to our one-bedroom  apartment, on the duskier side of town. Knock, Knock, Knock!    Through the cloudy peephole—  busking upturned brooms and twirling yellow gloves like rubber daisies,  plastic buckets, spongy sponges and bleach, so much white white bleach  to clean our home, because they could, because my mother let them in.    We are blessing you!  You work so hard and you are all alone, we are  the Christian Cleaning Brigade! You are a single mother, oh we pity,  let us clean, let us clean, they said — a singing choir to the least of these.    They started dusting and sweeping and sorting—  Oh, where does this go?  Is this trash? Is this trash? They chanted.  Opened closets, fingered our clothes and dishes, swish-clank-shut .  Our apartment was theirs. We, the strangers, brown bugs scattering  to edge the dusty baseboards with our shrinking bodies—got out of their way.    Where’s your vacuum dear? Oh it’s so old, my mother had one just like this.  The bright crucifix dangling over creamy clavicles like a pure silver bullet  swaying over the bathtub, a pendulum ticking and tocking the ceramic lip,  while milk-blue powder christened every mushroom-colored ring.    They made it snow.  And their makeup was porcelain perfect, too.  Plum-dark lip liner traced vermillion borders  as they smiled, they never stopped smiling—    until they found it, behind the toilet like a lurch. I forgot I left it there.  One lady came out with my stained underwear, holding it up and away  from her body like a stench. My period bruising the pearly cotton with  a smear of red poppies. My horror, my ooze, my face—    I was the adulteress caught  naked in the streets in front of Jesus. Their unsmiling, fake chilled faces  seeing my midras, my unclean spot before them.  The way they slashed their guillotine eyes at my fresh body—  to have had so much blood in me like a dirty, new sin. I was not yet twelve wedged in a small square of space on a balcony full of other used things a chair       old games  everyone else was asleep it had been raining for days I wore pajamas  the street was rain the tree was rain the captain’s villa across the street was rain the blue street lamps were rain the ribbon of my road to my right and left was rain the ocean on the other side of the house that I couldn’t see without leaving my room was rain  Midnight was rain I was seeing suitors in thunder.   We share a burger,  what he could afford,  in silence watch a troop of fire ants  ravage a crinkle fry  in the Baptist parking lot  where lovers go—above  the hospitals and decommissioned furnaces,  the best free view in town.  An hour before,  he’d shuffled atop me, hands splayed  as if climbing a mountain.  I watch him  lick fine salt dust from his thumb.  It will be years before I learn  this easy fact:  a lot of things are not contained  in rock and roll.  Like what to do  when that levy runs dry,  when to let a man  save face, and how  to let my anger simmer, stoic  as a blue gas flame,  so it stays lit  for years, feeding on air. I may have dreamed the preschool on a hill above the hospital, how the staff who did not at the time seem bored but seemed  to cherish us released us to the yard to watch the medevac touch down—a treat, the shocking noise, because we knew no  injury, and it was too far distant to make out small figures on the gurneys. And because my mother worked there, at the hospital,  I told myself she must be among the white coats rushing to meet the blades, and cheered her because I believed she could hear me and knew,  somehow, she needed it. Years later, over dinner, with her back turned to the television, she told me pointed stories about teenage mothers,  how small their babies were, the fathers had no teeth left—although the chance I’d end up doing meth was slim, or even that I’d learn  how to find it, since you can only ever tell after the fact, after the shit goes up in flames, after the whole mess blows—  then you can see beside some county road the charred halves of a mobile home, the burn so new the kudzu has not yet begun to cover it. Outside, late snowflakes fleck the car, reflect the red-green strands of light leftover  from the holiday. Three days after New Year’s, we are buying champagne. I watch you pull stiff  twenties from a pocket, the cash you made tonight, enough for a bottle and six-pack, enough  to drink ourselves to sleep. We have just come from a party where the room unspooled,  a girl collapsed on the sofa gripping a fifth of whiskey, her skirt hiked up around her thighs  to expose fine hairs, dark cotton underwear. You collect change, your shadow in the window  flickers with fluorescents over the aisles of mixers, of rum and vodka, jewel-like bottles of gin,  the TV monitor the clerk, briefly, glances from. The crowd had pressed around the girl,  then, bored, moved off to other rooms. I watched you pass a smoke among the boys  and I could still feel your hand span the back of my neck, jugular to jugular,  the pressure a hot buzz in my ears. I need to tell you, as you gather up  the booze, hold open the door, then pause to light a smoke below the flashing Open sign,  there are things I can never forgive us for: like the blonde wisps that escaped her underwear,  your slow nod as I told you she will deserve what’s coming. I thought she sickened me,  but I was too afraid to cover her, to roll together her soft thighs, pull the bunched hem down. Beyond those shuttered summer cottages, wind drives in off the Atlantic  down Galilee’s main street, its ice-encrusted pilings. It makes the rigging wires pine.  Under strung lamps women slicked in rubber gear are spearing skate into barrels.  Out there, beyond the breachway and the breakwater mark, in huge breathing heaves, Block Island sound.  The tide turns in frigid dark before the new year. Bells blare the next shift of fish workers back to the pier.  Cafes empty. Jackets on. Watch caps. Slap of double-gloved hand, creak of snow under boot,  red flare of a shared cigarette, frayed end of a frozen castoff line. Words thin to vapor in the air.  Deck lights, diesel fumes, muffled shouts, the boats rock out of their berths.  The trawlers pitch past Point Judith beacon, listening for her horn, and sonar gropes  for the wandering schools, yellowtail, cod, the big score, the harvest gone,  millions of tons vacuumed out by factory ships, a dent in every species, and it’s hard to see  the shrunken catch as anything but conspiracy, Washington somehow, Wall Street,  the banks, pirates and honchos shoving poker chips around a table in hot sun, slugging martinis, swatting at gnats.  Hard, hard to feel played for a fool and still to believe in moonlight and luck, a heavy draw  from the deep invisible future, a glowing shoal dead ahead, and to reach into the grave and get it. At the riveredge a pair of black swallowtails interleaf with sycamore inexactly, demonstrating which state of affairs made  Wittgenstein so queasy about names: no stick-um. What keeps the whole tree from letting loose a cloud of blue-laced wings this morning  occupies me, cured cold of adhesive but cautious, a reformed drunk on the boulevard. I still need to say this is this  for balance of a sort, each minute’s equation teetering on the equals sign like a pelican midharbor adjusting its load  of striped bass. Why else would it matter to hit the thing so squarely? Recognition extends the spectrum  a few doors down, any one of which may swing out the one, the kitchen of metaphor. It may not be a moral act.  Talking straight from the halfway house my brother says he’s learned his pleasure center’s maximum high’s temperature setting  operates to keep him running tilted after candy, a/c blasting, windows sprung, can’t do it, can’t cool the whole planet.  Fifty years or more my father’s carried cancer seeds in his belly and his dreams at night consume each waking thread  by thread but still he recalls polysyllabic trophies won in grade-school spelling bees: pneuma-leutra-micro-scopic-silico-volcan-osis  prints on me the diagnosis Stevens wrote,  an exquisite appositeness that takes away  verbality . What means, means, if we can bear it.  His eyes say more, but you just try instructing desire. I know this is the word for what I’ve got.       They line up at the edge of heaven and look over into the canyons  of earth. They have been delivered from fear. They have.  Their hearts are scorched in gratitude and their tongues are sweet with news.  Those who fell from heights. Those who drowned.  Those who bled from bullets. Those who starved.  If you could see them you would see they have all been delivered.  Come out in the snow. I am juggling orange balls  and it is so simple to stand here and count catch catch catch catch  release release release release and when I miss  I miss and start again. If I could see them I would wave  across the pond, the snowfield, the low pink sky. I wave anyway.  Can you hear their voices? They sound like wind.  They line up at the edge of heaven and throw down their garments,  which they will not need in their new lives.  Something falls with a thud. Something floats.  Swan feathers in the sea oats. Now I try that bright melody  but my feet are so slow and my head is thick. Birch bark is to tinder as virgin is to splendor.  Our animal selves, our orange cat,  your silvering chin pressing through my tinsel -thin winter cheek like a cranberry garland orb:  you, shearing this month’s bristles:  me, tallying your skin’s pits & wrinkles  ‘til they might as well equal mine and  —stop. You    can’t      giftwrap what’s germinating :holes  have always chinked atomic armor:       age  has never clocked in in equal opportunity.  Just think of us as cyborgs, imagine the lines for replacement  parts and the cost of labor set at every account’s rupture.  Reams of spruce needles for the season of dying: the festival of light bulbs incandescent asway in drops of frost.       Our darkness calmly wakes. Walking, it lifts her blind-bright seascape dream away, its grey crane cable spooling around her neck. It lives, despite what kind of accident the coroner might’ve called her belly full of perfume: every laugh is still dry straw. I disrobe the Crown Royal. I tap out qué será será on the leaf of my Sunday crossword for her ghost in the corner. As I watch a sill-pigeon peck and loft, I remember clam beds, sandpipers, calm ripples—not a still shadow in sight—where, left with our shadow-selves, a lone whooping crane high-steps the mangrove’s edge, stalking the live link between dream-burst of sun and dark incarnate. i wanted to feed my heart to the birds but i heard if you feed a bird the wrong thing it’ll explode. what if my heart is the wrong thing?  what if my heart is the trick of an eye? the stripper’s chainsaw grin? the xanax addict’s plagiarized laugh? the booster’s adrenaline-rushed? what if my heart is that? what if my heart is a voicemail erased by accident? what if my heart erased the voicemail? what if the voicemail wasn’t even for my heart to begin with? what if my heart is feathers but they’re blood kissed? what if my heart is a walkman someone broke in 8th grade? what if i still have all the cds for it? what if some songs still play if you hit it against something sharp? what if my heart is renisha mcbride’s knock? what if my heart’s “help”  is answered in death? what if my heart is the weed they claimed was in sandra bland’s system? what if my heart never really existed? what if my heart is sandra bland? what if my heart does not exist anymore? what if my heart is the crossroads bone-thugs-n-harmony crooned over? would you meet me there? why did they take his uncle charles y’all? what if my heart is uncle charles y’all? what if my heart is the projects? what if everyone here is secretly trying to get out? what if the ones who stay are the ones they say did not know any better? what if my heart is cleveland ohio september 2015? what if my heart is 43 murderers in one month? what if my heart is what a 3-year-old boy named major will never have but deserves? what if my heart is a chance to grow up? what if my heart is afraid to take chances?  because it knows those who might have lost them? what if my heart knows what it is capable of? what if my heart can’t tell the difference between humans and the birds? what if my heart knows the difference but no longer cares? The fish, split and gutted, jumped while limp in your hands  though it was far from the river, and the dog whined  from the forest, would no longer trail your truck or enter  the house. Suddenly, you had no bug bites in August. No dark  wet marks bloomed like mouths beneath your arms,  even as the sun made crumbling paper of the leaves,  as neighbors fell ill for weeks, as moths died one  by one against the windowpanes, heaps of them quivering  in the morning wind, swirling like ash from a fire.  The yard turned vacant but for pigweed and tickseed. The ivy’s  severed skeleton tumbled its backbone from the house.  What did you do, I said. What happened to you?  But you only threw the fish into the pan, clamped  the lid to hold it down, and you would not relent  to its suffering. These days my heart is always tearing  away from itself like a horse broken loose in a storm. He has a million fleeting thoughts without a reason to recall them. Across the countryside, the far-fetched sound of cattle lowing. Conspirators, he thinks, you can have it, not noticing this smallest leaf.  *  In a rowboat, one’s living loses its exactness, finds inlets, offshoots. If I’d wanted to be triumphant, I would have chosen other work. You say beyond— I say one more time across the creek’s five stepping stones.  *  The uncomplicated nature of grace sends the mind reeling. A favored view’s endangered for all the years it stays intact. Assembling years of details won’t make the self an open meadow.  *  Only a few times one gets to see that yellow bird from tree to wholly gone. THE JOB OF STICKING  They figured it out when you were five and had an unending thirst and smeary vision. Your dad, Irish weeper, got the job of sticking you twice a day. Each time, he apologized. Couldn’t look you in the eye. By the time you were ten he’d shown you the trick with the orange. How to stick the needle in. How its skin was just like yours, with pores and a thickness keeping everything in.    MONKEY OR METAL  After the funeral, where I chickened out and somebody else read my poem, the photographer from The Greenwich Time shoved his big black camera in our faces as we embraced. I shrieked at him like a monkey or metal on metal. Then, everyone went to your house and ate beautiful food out of beautiful dishes. And every time someone came up to you to say: I’m sorry, I’m so sorry , you forgave them, exquisitely.    THE TRACKS NOT EVEN  Probably Philip was drunk when the train hit him. He liked Jack Daniels, and used to perch a bottle on a stool in the garage behind your house where he lived those last months. At night, you could see it, a glowing amber totem, through the little square-eyed windows. Later, I read somewhere that you can’t hear the train coming at all from down on the tracks. Not even the whistle which somebody said the conductor blew and blew and blew but Philip and the other kid, they never turned around.    CARRY BACK  Then, it was so easy for us to disappear. Just walk out of school and jump into the old Toyota we’d resurrected from your backyard. The car your dad insisted would never run again. We willed that thing to catch with the will of young girls desperate to get out. It caught, and your dad, he just threw his arms up and let us have it. In those long, untethered afternoons you and I would drive the back country. Roads with stone walls held together with nothing but time. All the way into Westchester and once across the Tappan Zee to Rockland. As if we were looking for something to carry back with us.  One day, I paint my mother’s face with rocks – pound Dolostone, Basalt, Quartzite into powder,  dribble spit into what I crush, rub paint onto her nose, cheeks, forehead – every streak one finger  wide. My mother: remade. Wild, glossed with magic. I take a picture, try to fix her as warrior companion.  I wave the polaroid like a smoke blessing, wait for it to dry. When I look up, she’s gone.  Later, I find her in her sewing room – face washed off, her foot on the pedal of her machine as though she is driving  our brown Oldsmobile to the milk store. The windows are open. Streetlights buzz. It’s Indian Summer .  Heat blurs the trees into smudged still lives. My mother stuffs elastic  into a waistband, sends me to bed. I lean out my window like a dog. Bats reel. Rabid. Lucky. I squirm  all night, searching for the cool part of my cotton sheets, those places my body has not yet been.  The no-smoking sign glows with its little flame, flickers when the plane drops. I’m nowhere above somewhere – rows of seat backs  like tombstones – waiting for a wing to rip, waiting to fall – cockeyed – through a cloud – trail of ash – evidence rinsed by rain.  A girl next to me – maybe twenty – clings to the knee of a girl next to her – a terrifying age to die. Only minutes ago they flipped  through catalogs, pointing at blouses they might buy. Now I imagine they imagine clothes that might spill from suitcases, which dress  might catch in a tree – billow like a girl dancing alone until even the wind dies. I wonder what they regret – who they never  slept with – and if their panties will float, anonymous, into a corn field. I wonder who will kneel for them, inconsolable. how oranges deliquesce in the shallow bowl  how old roses smell of linen cabinets and wool sweaters of camphor  how boxcars tattooed in fluorescent colors carry coal past grade schools  how mercy is a blindered horse  how one tornado brought down a steeple and deposited bank statements six counties away  how we cannot hear the spider’s shuttle nor do we listen for it. Smell of home pulls a salmon. Then its metallic body, wrestled from current, spirals in sun.  An old woman beats its skull with an igneous stone. Her braids rope down her chest.  A man filets it with a toothed knife, two quick strokes, wraps the meat in plastic.  She rockets the carcass over the line of men fishing to gulls that rasp and rip for flesh.  My daughter watches and comes against me, her hands on me, and I give her nothing.  The old woman holds the body of the salmon, she is swift with the stone, swift as hunger.  She steps away from the fish, makes room for the man and his knife with a mouth of teeth.  It happens so fast and keeps happening: the woman, the igneous rock, the fish, all of it pulling  through memory, mine, my daughter’s. And still I have nothing to give her.       Start by leaning against your car until you glow like a broken cowboy song and unlearn your father’s hands. Listen as the radio tells you how to leave: a dog who walks across a state to sleep on a different farmer’s porch. Shift into first, let cattails remind you of the silencer on a gun, silos to quit drawing crows on the sleeves of your varsity jacket. Push to second & watch the night become the same before you were born: stars tipped like sawgrass, a town of daughters dreaming of tying sharecroppers to bedposts & burning fallow over their necks. By third, let part of you become pool hall & the other scarecrow: a butcher-paper moon glows, a pack of cigarettes grows damp on the porch. Pass a 7-Eleven & the ghost of boys looking for animals to cut their names into. Hang down your arm like a crop duster & listen to the foxes cry about growing teeth in the middle of the night. Watch a woman strike a match like she’s walking from a burning barn as you ease into fourth. Now, remember the girl who washed her hair in bathtub gin & made you lick the ends dry. The entire road will begin to smell like thunder. finds the lump under her breast you name every deer – a town of boys who built fires from bird bones & dirt under their nails. Stopping for gas, you predict their futures: half DJs, half accountants, a small percent who cure cancer. By the reservoir you watch as one hands out cigarettes from behind his antlers, hear him tell the story about a mother from the city who drowned her newborn in the lake, how the herd just stared like falling asleep in church. You think back to your mother – rifle across her lap like the wishbone of a bear, remember how you have never held a gun. Now another deer talks of body, a ghost that takes years to shoot down & fill with clay, a bird trapped in a hardware store that sleeps on the bandsaw at night. By morning the deer are getting rowdy & someone decides to tip over birdfeeders. Leaving, you finish your cigarette, lungs filling & emptying like a boy opening comics & tearing out pages. You cross one more field & see a doe painted white, realize this is the work of the boys. Walking over like a cloud leaving orbit, she blinks for years & asks to be fed. You clean the paint from her blaze. You have never held a gun. Dear Leona for the Manila Envelope Filled With Hair Clippings   that I want        to compare to mine though I am sure             it remains  foreign             & like the rest of you  a lighthouse             i once dreamt fit in my small                   pale hands Dear  Leona I want             to windstorm the parts of you    that mean  the least to me             The curious swish  of your scare-             curved back undressing             in the moonless  ambivalence             of a clinic The shh  of blond hair        meeting sanitized tiles almost comforting             but broken  as a mother’s             promise to wake. I know a winter that ends with a mouth full of ice.  The body licked clean and licked cleaner.  Nothing leaves a scar as wide as a secret.  I am slicing open the river’s numb spine.  I am slicing open each man with his own knife.  I pray there is no such thing as red.  Yet each secret is a blood- drop through snow.  So I can breathe & shout whenever I’d like.  But memory is still soft and bruised through winter.  I have learned & re-learned my careful tread of want.  I have learned that terrible body- shuffle once impulse leaves.  I know a box of matches won’t burn the skin to dusk. When it was thought that the light would come down fancifully like a thought struck or a clock struck one, the woman laid down her coffee cup— thought of some laundry on a pole and the light bearing down as if it were taking a shit. It was dirty— not like the light in the stories with the women and their honey-gold hair, but like seeds being strewn across a broad and gray landscape or berries being crushed on a floor. There are no black flowers, only the darkest shades  of purple or red. We look at flowers as a way to know where we are.  In the orchid garden, winter never arrives. Gardeners work quietly to remove traces of dirt  and decay. The messes of mortality remain hidden. But a secret seeps back in. There’s your shoulders or your neck— there’s your jaw or your mouth—I greet them in order—you reply in kind—I remember fewer and fewer words—there’s your tongue or your teeth—our language lost but so useful, so useful— and right, for a second, so right—I remember again, your shoulders—I find them at work, lifting then prone—I fit my hands to the muscle under the blades—so alert, oh god, and moving— I could labor my whole life under that span—my palms flat against it—my body underneath, drawing from its drive—it’s surely wrong to call this aching grace—it’s wrong to call it grace— but I need it, so I name it—then I take it, and I take it— I learned to say you can do  whatever you want to me before knowing desire’s imagination.      ~      I gave names to the bodies I shouldn’t touch,  incanted them in the made rooms of backseat, against-the-floor .  I worshipped their new names despite myself: how their vowels rang out in my open mouth.      ~      I bent low before their shoulders, their stomachs, mistaking servitude for devotion:  as the first man uttered  trust me, I granted him each side of my face until it purpled.      ~      What did I learn?— how to operate my changing body like a ferry: forwards  to the black idea of touching, backwards from the door that locks behind us.  What did I learn?— at first, the door to life and the door to the river both only say open .      ~      What did I learn? —after fucking,  while they leave or sleep, in my bathroom or theirs, the quiet ritual of erasing them from inside me:  blotting them from my legs, confessed  by the lamp, the mirror.      ~      I count and weigh their pleasure like coins for the ferryman.  I walk with them each time across that shore from living to dead to living.      ~  How ugly I’ve grown     into a forgetfulness. I’ve lost my manners because drought has taken all the glassware from my cupboard and I can’t gesture water. But love, if you want to go wild in the china shop of my body, do. I warn you, I am an idiot at touch. You don’t believe me— look at the hydrangeas. They’re so blue. To be breathed out   by the box kite bought at Walmart on his last afternoon, $5.99/  his hairbrush upturned on the bathroom counter/by  the dark he woke to, tree frogs  in undergrowth, the rusted shed with its lock shattered, what word/for  our hands fumbling in pure  daylight/by our tracks browning the carpet,  his Thai elephant missing a single ivory tusk/by what choral theater  allowed me to think/  portable home, a little immortality/  by Xanax from his bag of last possessions, clattered down steps  of the funeral home/by  relentless relief/he was gone, his nowhere pivot/   the crew swearing in soaked t-shirts, the flatbed  heaved away/  by his wallet perched on my washing machine back home. Cicada   When is a self its surface breaking. My boy crushes husks with his plastic cup    and my thought of skin seared down a middle, and periodic rising    from dirt, tunnels cored along the sides of long roots. We pull them    where they cling, non-things. Summer rattles its incomplete arc:    bee balm, flagrant purple, phlox lineate the patio.    If a child was missing his eyes and wings, others came with their hands    to guide him. Rocked all sequence of floors in a dark house,    and fans whirred their sound where he could sleep, he lay outside you.                   Remember how droplets skittered the fry pan?   Heat changes everything. Onions turn savory, morning glory climbs, bread dough left under white kitchen towels swells and rises. The warmth of my husband’s arms at night changes the way I look  back on the day. Heat rising from quarrels can curl the old photo on the wall—Edith picking huckleberries plumped to perfect in August Dog Days. On the farm heat meant life in summer, determined  whether the pump froze in winter. Heat was her medium: apple pie, strawberry jam, johnnycake. She’d carry sweet rolls down the road to a daughter, truck blueberry buckle  to church socials. Heat ruled Edith’s life.  She read temperatures like tea leaves. Were spring nights warm enough for seedlings? Was the baby’s forehead so hot the doctor must come?  Years monitoring canning kettle, wood stove, flatiron. And later, last warmth creeping from Herbert’s hand that winter, when all the firewood in the world was not enough. There’s a catch on the pressure cooker lid, crucial as the one on autoclave,  coffin. A golden latch on a Faberge egg, and hidden ones in each of my aunt’s cunning  puzzle boxes, secret pins locked out every cousin but one. So many things A mother can’t explain—  how a toad gets down a wire  into a birdhouse, why it wants  to be there    and about the one  pale blue egg that falls, too,  onto the dry August grass. February 5, 2014   Chance of snow storm in northeastern United States: definite Favorite winter storm names so far this year: Ion, Pax, Wiley Least favorite: Atlas, Hercules, Titan Chance of my name being used: still hopeful Ironic weather moment of the day: ship washed ashore in the Philippines from Typhoon Haiyan embellished with the words: SAFETY FIRST CO2 levels worldwide: 397.80 ppm Number of chemical weapons worldwide: hard to tell Earth’s heart rate: 267 beats per minute Current emotions: where to put this cyclone. She thinks she remembers before, the lavender mist sprayed on bedspreads, the ease of switching on a light, the breath of an acoustic guitar. She hadn’t noticed any war playing out, each bomb an isolated image of smoke and fire so far away. A man’s bloodshot eyes and another man’s tears. She keeps finding guns after a full moon as they sweep in with the tide searching for powerful hands. The only things ever real were what she once held in her hands – warm coffee mugs, a dog’s leash, a cotton bra. She isn’t sure if chlorine ever existed, if she is clever enough to have invented something as grand as the sun or a toddler’s laugh. Instead, she digs down, deep into the dark sand, burying guns like little bodies.          After the accident, pain wanted to be seen. Only the aperture of a machine upstairs could spot the slim notch scored into the driftwood mantle of my right collar bone. The technician left me  in the room alone with this part of myself aglow on the screen. No mention of the ribs—each slow swipe of icing on a layer cake, shallow drift of snow on the rim of a garden pot left out too long. Nor the pottery scapula or the long-handled spoons hung to each side.  They have names, I remembered: radius, ulna. But I saw the cross-work of kite frames. A cello bow. The bunched white peony bud of the skull, and the hatched open jaw. A body more beautiful than the strict illustration posted on the wall. Mine clattered its pieces like a wind chime  as I stood and reached for my shirt, unfurled cotton folds between two beaded chandeliers. Each knuckle of light warmed in an instant, enough to hold each button, a hammer, any pen, every doorknob. Unclasp the flesh from this hour, the hour from its season, the leather tongue  that cinches me inside this body, this gravity. What could I see  once loosened? As a scarf that flies in the wind, or a mirror that swallows  the slow colors of a violet potted on the sill. The motion and shadow  of what we call lives, bowed heads of horses by firelight, and nervous little dogs  in the painting on the wall. What I want is to be one of those birds  in the margins, longing for absolution. Not from sin; from limits, from sameness.  My ideas about wings, pipette mechanisms of filament and frost.  Never strong enough to carry my weight from the frame.       In the world before this one, all my lovers fell to my feet like soldiers in a bombed gully.  I placed framed photographs of them in the Thien Mu Temple, arranged fresh oranges on a plate.  August 1963: Thich Quang Duc took a baby-blue Austin Westminster to Phan Dinh Phung Boulevard.  He sat in the lotus position while another monk poured petrol over his darkening robes.  Police in white-and-khaki uniforms kept protesters from hurling into the flames with their batons.  Black smoke exploded like wings from his body, which did not move except to bow before the Buddha.  When he fell back on the street, a camera lunged forward to record his final minutes in this universe.  Everything burned but his heart, which remained intact and wrapped in sunlit cloth.  In dreams, I touch his handsome face and blaze in the battlefield where my past loves wait.  I’m the field. I’m the fire unwilling to release them in fear no one else will want me. He pressed a white towel against my face— It smelled  like sugar— Winter wilted in my lungs—  An ice cream truck on San Pablo Avenue played its song—  My phone rang but I couldn’t answer— He nailed me  into the bed— Everything came off— Even the condom—  I stopped breathing— All night he searched my body  for something he lost becoming a man exiled  from what he loved— He didn’t love me— He loved what he could do  with his curiosity— That’s how I learned imagination is human  nature’s cruelest weapon—   October 1966: Twilight draped its ao dai over the rice fields.  Two American ships patrolled the My Tho River. A Viet Cong fleet ambushed them  from behind. Grenades detonated in the water. Missiles struck  thermal shadows. Both sides radioed for help. A helicopter attack squad called  the Seawolves descended with torpedoes, blasted the Viet Cong battalion  until bones couldn’t be separated from the lilies. I woke, and there he was—  on top of me, groaning low like a ceiling fan, his blades cleaving  the night. I woke and saw a child with my face leap into the crossfire,  collecting what remained of its dead before the cannibals advanced. A root of balm, a root of bane [1] the news pronounces  these days. I call it all painful. Wind flays the trees  beside the river we cross to get to school, library,  the rest of the world and an old oak has had too much,  reared itself, shown its mess, its new logic: naked root,  black earth, its death. The levels of betrayal are infinite  in Donal’s new article about the IRA, the Army, peace  makers. I am lost tracking them and can’t anymore.  Back home, the instrument of chimney blows a wild tune  I don’t want to know, Christ, I say, don’t we cover up  those old things? The chill waft from between bricks  is inexplicable. A body absorbs all kinds of things,  cold, the pavement, the father shot when he was five,  the gorgeous image of torn root, the wet of a window  weeping with condensation, the vivid hedge beyond.  Today’s storm is named Henry. Before that, Gertrude,  Frank and Eva. Desmond, Clodagh, Barney, and finally  Abigail, but there is no story for this stew, this day.  There is no illuminating anecdote to pass us through  its gust and confusion. Noli me tangere , is what  Jesus said to Mary Magdalene when she recognized him  after his death. The original Greek translates better,  maybe, Cease holding on to me . Men in reflective vests  and city coveralls touch the broken bits strewn on grass,  the gnarled oak’s below. It will be gone tomorrow. What are they doing in the next room?   is it substantial? or in? is it more than the sum of my labors? more than today’s, yesterday’s?   Are they interested in feelings? They seem to have a lot of them, more colored and richer than mine. The kind of feelings that give them   all kinds of credibility, since who else could feel them so acutely? “Feelings Are Not Wrong or Right, They Breed” will be my next tattoo,   next to the tattoo I already regret, “Me + Them” in a heart composed of barbed wire. The furniture is being rearranged, rather,   scraped across the wood floor and the commotion seems self-important. Are they barricading the door? Are they being imprisoned? by whom?   I won’t worry too much about this, Surely they will let me know when it’s time, when they explode. I don’t have such complaints, or I do but maybe not so urgent ones   considering the condition of everything else in the world, which is them. But what could be that noise? a mournful cri de coeur   followed by an utterly believable moan. They would let me know if I should be braver, I guess, but if that sound came from a person   I hope they let me know how mine compare. Or should I pretend I don’t care? Could someone really be shooting a gun in there? Maybe it’s only a cork decorking or the sudden exhale of one in a state of deep satisfaction, though is that possible anymore, is it?        We buried the cat today, in the corner  of the yard. No fanfare, just a sprig  of kangaroo paw and some lavender,  the hole barely big enough for a shoebox.  Shovel in hand, I felt the loose soil  spill into the grave, returned whence  it came. The cat, ragged incisors curved  over her lip, claws protruding nakedly  from yellowed paws, lay in the bottom  of the box. As a child, I woke often  to those claws on the window screen,  an electric racket followed by the sound  of feet dropping onto corrugated tin  like clumps of wet dough. In her eyes,  the whole world startled into peaks  of green and yellow, flame-ringed  and clear as if preserved under glass.  At the center, the pupils, two slits  impossibly black, orbs that widened  after the light. Strange, what death  throws into bright relief. How it reaches  into the present, cinches to a fist  without warning. I feel this way watching  my daughter play, face bent over a book  or brightly colored toy, the moment  already laced with nostalgia. Each day,  I forget. How she looked at birth,  folds of skin gathered in the creases  of her legs. We buried the cat today,  and now I’m in the nursery, soothing  the baby after she’s woken crying,  haunted by sleep. I cross the room with  long, slow steps. Her body grows still.  I lean over the crib, lower her gently  back to slumber, and linger, feeling  the moments as they pass. This life  we’re losing, even as we live it. The year you were born, they tore down the oak  tree behind our building. I saved a branch  to remember it by, then the cherry-pickers  came with men in orange vests and hard hats,  and, for five days, the air filled with sawdust,  the sound of wood giving way to metal.  They cut it in parts: first the topmost branches,  then, in sections, the larger limbs. The trunk  they saved for last, then excised in chunks  which thudded to the ground to be mulched.  Last went the roots, dug up from soil.  Midway through, the men stopped work  to circle the stump, which oozed black sap.  Sometimes I forget what the tree actually looked like,  a patchwork of green and gold shimmering  like a live field outside your window.  At bedtime, we lie and watch paper fish  drift in steady orbits overhead, stirred  by summer breeze. I’m not sure you remember  the oak. How it felt, knowing it would be cut,  that each moment it remained came measured  from a miser’s bank account. How to explain  the need to hold, to make it last . Each night  before bed, you lean over the rim of your plastic tub  to inspect the faucet, body twisted into a tiny  question mark. You slap the water, palms flashing,  face split with delight as the surface erupts in  a spray of silver. How many more moments  like this do I get? It’s when I’ve scooped you  out of the tub, turned the water down  the drain that I miss you most. I fold you  in terrycloth, press my cheek to yours  and see, in the mirror, your warm face,  towel-tousled, spangled with wet lashes.  How I ache. Unbearably, impossibly happy. Remember with me the world blinded by noon-  day sun. The slow-moving gait of water buffalo  shambling down the road, bellies so broad  and crusted with mud, they pass for prehistoric  reptiles. How each sunset lights the river on fire  like kerosene poured from a flame-colored sky.  It’s been decades, but I haven’t forgotten  the streets; elegant, weary boulevards lined  with teak trees and wrought-iron gates, buildings  that still buckle under the weight of empire.    This, a city of remnants: a strand of hair fallen  from Buddha’s head, a footprint preserved  in stone when he passed—or was it a dragon?  Details that elude, even as they’re remembered.  A pile of feathers and stringy, shredded meat  at the bottom of a bird cage, the work  of an adopted stray cat later found dead  in a pool of spilled petrol. Our pet menagerie.  I’ll go back someday, though I don’t speak  the language, can’t remember how to piece  the city back together; but mute, lost, living  as if underwater, that’s how we first arrived.    A trick of childhood, that places remembered  seem grander than they are. Once, I returned  to our old house, found it strangely diminished.  Plaster walls worn; the main house squat, provincial.  The marble wasn’t marble but polished concrete;  the grounds, overrun with frangipani bushes,  a riot of coconut trees, had dramatically shrunk.  The world recedes. Moss-covered, crumbling  stupas at every intersection, temple walls etched  with dragons, keepers of the gate. What’s the tale?  A virgin sacrifice; some ancient, toothy curse.  And our little family—we vanished without a trace.  Handprints left in concrete, a pair of dead sparrows  buried in the front yard. How little we leave behind. I  In her womb, I grew from the center of her belly and stretched into her hips. side to side, I stayed stubborn.  Her large laughs bounced me, her garrulous tongue, my storybook.  My head neither North, nor South I refused to turn, refused to make space for someone else.  Knowing she couldn’t love me on the outside like she did on the inside.  They cut her from hip to hip and lifted the eight pound weight out of her.  A child toned and tuned— the sound entirely different  and the look, female.  II   The tide was coming up on her chair  and her toenails were flaking pink.  I am ten years old  asking her to hug. I’m crying because I got stung by a jellyfish.  My father has tromped off into the water to scoop the jelly by a cup and kill it on the sand.  My mother is drinking her canned coors light offering to pour it on my leg; the alcohol kills the sting. The salt water mixed with sunscreen and the sun stings my eye, and I’m crying, so it’s burning even more. I don’t really care about the beer on my leg or the sting or the vengeance of a jellyfish. I have chill bumps all over my body and my teeth are chattering. I want my mother to put down her beer and hold me.  III  We are in the living room after dinner. She is talking amends as she holds me. I’m now taller than she and her head is in my breast and I can feel her breathing, can feel her belly pushing into mine. I am uncomfortable and comforted. I’m not sure what her eyes are doing but mine are searching the room, searching for a corner where I can focus.  IV   “I wasn’t lucky like you. I didn’t have a father who loved me.” I am twelve or thirteen tucking her into bed. She said all this to help me understand the bitterness. In the morning when the hangover passed, she wouldn’t remember. “My mother didn’t care where I was. No one did. I would sneak out just to get caught. I would drink beers skating down the side walks just so they would notice.”  “Did they?”  “No.”  As she begins to cry, I hug her and run my hands through her short hair. I say, “I’m sorry, Mama. That’s not fair. I’m so sorry.”  She says, “You are so lucky, so lucky, you just don’t know.” I keep thinking of those deer hip bones  the grey and the lightning bolt between them  I’m sorry for stealing this image, Michael  but it made me want to be beaten in a shed out back  made my head want to be a ram’s skull  two horns protruding out of me  so everyone could see my pain. What I’m trying to say is  it would be better if I was naked and bruised  if something so bad had happened to me  that I deserved a hug  that I deserved some warm milk from a mammal.    When my lover doesn’t want me  when she rejects touching me,  I miss my father’s jeans  how he would let me rub my dirty hands on the pant leg  the same way my grandfather let me do with his khakis—  the men in my family affectionate.    And here, I married a woman  like my mother  her coldness like deer bones.  Wet wood. Empty shed.  The phone rings and it is never anyone giving me money.  Church ceilings painted to look like skies fill me with fury.  The pew hard against my back, I’d rather be  outside and how many times in my life have I said  what was I saying again , distracted by something  beautiful like stained glass, something ugly  like a slur. And I have been called a dirty Irish girl,  prepared to throw down in the coffee shop,  one time in my life this happened, some people  have slurs wrap around them like skin.  Once, affectionately, I tried calling a friend  a bitch and the word lay between us like egg  shell and yolk smashed and oozing on the plate, when here  I thought it was hard-boiled.  Have you ever seen  the feet of a ballet dancer? Mangled toes and  calluses. I didn’t have the arch, or the discipline.  I picture words like ballet slipping away as I get older,  and oh the leaps my hands will make to mime.  My grandmother had many feelings toward  the Japanese, as a WWII vet, and forgot all of them  because of her roommate Michiko in the nursing home.  I have had loss in my life. My grandmother crying in my arms  after grandfather died, so worried they’d have to  cut off his feet to fit him in the coffin.    Waking up after you have taken enough pills  to die is a strange feeling, I felt so horribly sick  to my stomach and surprised, if anything.  Teetering around the room like an invalid,  I threw up, I brushed my teeth, I washed my face.  People have told me they would pray for me.  That God wouldn’t let me be an atheist.  I hope it made them feel better.  What makes me feel better is someone  lightly rubbing their fingers along my scalp.  The shampoo girl does it perfectly.  I allow myself this every few months.  Any more than that, I start to feel self-indulgent. The Boy Rilke    …not yet really  life; still only growing-time  that drags at the knees—, time of defenseless waiting…  — R.M.R., “Duration of Childhood” (trans. Stephen Mitchell)     Even through the small, streaked window of the slightly damaged photograph, you can see what a difficult epoch it was for children, and for young René (not yet Rainer) especially: so many layers of rigid clothing and buttons for larger hands to fuss with, such poor light, harsh textiles. At three, the shadows were already settling beneath his eyes; his mother’s house in Prague was the tightness of collars, the distance of ceilings, velvet chairs whose cushions wouldn’t give but prickled the skin of his calves; and wherever he went was the ghost of a sister, her shadow-life laid precisely on his own. Nevertheless the patterns of rugs entranced him (a Persian code of flowers pulsing wider, finer, wider, though it hurt his hands to trace), and under the dog’s wiry hairs there was pungent warmth and a strangeness, a volatile quickness that trembled just like him. Laid in his small bed, he had no words for the visions that flowed through him unimpeded, present and continuous as air. He closed his eyes to the dark and a brilliant violet trembled against it, trembled and fluttered, fluttered and pulsed. After the lights in the pool came on,  I’d float face-up just under the surface,  watching the trees and the deepening sky  ripple and wave, and waiting for dark  shapes of bats to come diving and skating  the plane of the water. They were more  a peculiar turn of motion than any  animal I quite believed in — little  strobic silhouettes, black flurries  cutting the light like a fault in film,  quick dark marks abraded by  some roughness in another space.  They seemed more determined than birds  and more desperate, caught in a vital  frenzy to stay in flight, throwing every  muscle and beat of their bodies against  the fact of their bodies’ falling.  I’d seen their bones in pictures, hands  like thin-drawn versions of my own.  To share that breath felt dangerous.  Still, I looked for them in winter,  having read they’d stow away in sheds  or basements during the freezing months.  I never found any, though I searched,  following my breath to shadowed bays  where ice laced its clean, tiny knots,  folding itself in and out of being, etched  like glyphs inscribed and taken back  by an indifferent, mercurial hand  on the other side of the air. A cupped palm, a few stolen redbuds  in the fluorescent light of the night bus.  Already now the dogwoods issue  their bulletins to all cardinal points.  It is twilight again. I have missed this blue.  I want to bruise the redbuds with my fingers,  break them in my teeth. I do not move.  I would like the closeness of a warm rain,  the weight of it, that intimacy. I watch.  The blue deepens. The night bus carries  its box of light past the edge of the city. I kill a baby raccoon with my car  on Scuttlehole Road, and feel sick    the night my sister Nina  dreamed she died.    “I tried to tell you,” she says to Allison.  “But my texts wouldn’t send…  because I was a ghost.”    There are too many omens this weekend,  even when we play cards at the kitchen table  and my father walks unluckily through the room  while I’m reading “if someone refuses  to go down on you, you ___________.”    He pours bourbon over vanilla ice cream  and retreats to the bedroom.    My mother’s feet in his lap  gives me a strange feeling of childhood again.    “Oh my god” she says at the television  What? I ask  But she doesn’t explain.    Allison’s turn to judge:  “I got 99 problems but a ___________ ain’t one.”    Her boyfriend submits Grandma .    “No one wins,” Allison says and rips  the grandma card into fourths.    I’m reminded of how solemn a child she was.  No take backs.    Her boyfriend defends himself.  “I meant it cause she was dope,  she was never a problem .”    But the card is gone and so is she  and so is the bourbon.  I’m waiting on something that never arrives.  It doesn’t even rain. i.    You keep alive a succulent for six years  and then it begins to fail, the leaves purple,  so you put yourself into the dry bed  and feel for the roots, bury them in your wet hands.    The first time a man said oh babe, oh babe, babe  when he was about to cum  you thought it meant he liked you.  By the next one you know better.    You want to know about entropy  like a scientist, not like a poet  where the natural world stands in  for your emotional landscape.  The universe is inexorably expanding  and you are so sad inside the Lincoln tunnel.    There are creosote bushes in the Mojave dessert  12,000 years old. They’re nothing spectacular  and they could be you; what you want above all is endurance.    Your care for the succulent is like how men  care for you, which is to say occasional,  which is to say what goes around, comes –  No, no it just goes.    ii.    Leaving a man’s apartment in Brooklyn,  you go to your sister, smelling like sex,  and kiss her cheek. It might be a one-time thing  but a psychic told you two years ago  that his initials would be important.    He donated his kidney to a stranger, and when you saw  his scar you felt awed and afraid for him,  you wanted to sleep with him.  What is it like to be so good?    You and your sister collaborate on a text message  to her boss, figure out where to put the haha .  You want to be liked, but sometimes forget how.  Your sister never forgets.  You wash the dog who’s dirty from the Prospect Park pond.  The shower scares him to shivers every time,  you say Mister Shakes, it’s okay.    Life is simple when it’s about calming the dog,  getting on the subway when you’re wine-sick,  remembering to email that student.    You take the sun’s shocking portrait  but the color never comes out right, does it?    It doesn’t matter, the sun doesn’t need you  to look good. It’s exactly itself so don’t waste your time.    Don’t read your tarot cards either,  you know you won’t handle it gracefully  when you turn over Death.    You get Death more than anyone you know  like it’s time to end something but you don’t know what. My brother once told me if I ate the leaves on the ground  they would turn to ice cream in my mouth.  I want to return to the moment of my belief  though the moment of my disillusionment is good, too,  the dirt and paper crunch of the maple leaves on my teeth and tongue. all month long  I was lonely. I  disinfected the  sink. I spoke  to boys in orange  jumpsuits who  were not allowed  to shake my hand.  for Halloween, I  brought in milk  chocolate bars  and the security  guard told them  One You can only  have one until a  boy unclipped his  mouth and said  Okay okay We  get it already  We’re in jail  and the chocolate  flashed quickly  on their thick  boy-tongues.  all month long  they asked me  who I was, what  was I doing. I  drew curly letters  on a board and  passed out  pencils. their  eyes hit  the ceiling,  they said No  No We don’t write—  then wrote about  matchsticks and  daughters, wrote  about roofs  and car tires  and sticky sugar  in cinnamon rolls.  they wrote, and  thru the doors,  in came their  old loves, wearing  jeans and red  sneakers, in  came bedframes,  sports magazines,  nail clippers.  in came brothers,  the feeling of  arm hair against  arm hair and  baby’s wrists,  fire, Drake lyrics,  cups of ice cream,  dizzy spins in the  front seat of  a black car.  and in came  my ghosts,  too: pattering  into the room  with mouths  open, dodging  our hard glares,  arms sagging  with all that  had flocked  and gone.  the boys said  We don’t write,  the room filled  and filled.  by the time  I left, the tables  teemed with  a million  basketballs, wisps  of candy, threads  of lightning, loss,  they scribbled  on tall sheets  with their  pencils. they  did not cry.  every-day,  they blazed  the old ghosts  off of everything. Your Mom Tells You To Stop Writing About Race    so you punch buttons. so you side-part  your hair. so you flip thru TV channels  and watch monkeys howl with their bare  monkey lips, so you are reminded of your  father. a gas station, a black nozzle, a man  in the adjacent car pinching his eyes, his  wide, blue face: telling you to go back  home. you draw shark teeth on your  american culture homework. you raise  your hand in class. your house becomes  a zoo filled with peaches, watercolor  roosters. each year, you walk and you  walk and your feet perform quietly  in the grass. every body asks you for  tricks, their name in black calligraphy.  every body coos and coos. there  are cages, and there are your eyes.  there are your ten-thousand days, eggy  and glorious, stuck thru the teeth of  a comb. your skin is sticky and yellow.  your tongue is ancient and sweet. when  a boy plumps his lip on your throat  and asks you to say something dirty  in CHINESE, you flip the sheets  and bite down, tasting trouble  and rage. in the kitchen, alone,  you devour a pickle. your white  classmate sees you. does not.  white men claim you. do not.  you are small, fierce and evil: with  two palms and a chest. there are  boxes made for you to check. Chinese/  American. Chinese/American.  your mom calls. she tells you to stop  writing about race. You could get  shot, she says. so you yank your hair  into a knot at the back of your neck.  so you cinch your belt tight at the waist. your children are the rice sacks saved for winter—  keep them safely enclosed for the time being  before the water recedes over your doorstep  & over you & trucks sway outside your window  like overworked water buffalo        even rice  can become a commodity in times like this—  see the stripped shelves at the lawson’s  & the water will reach your knees  & the water will reach your shoulders  & the water will sweep over your head like a taxi  & the debris will dress your waist like a skirt  & the dogs will bark until they drown  in the window of a forgotten kimono shop  All Summer I Wore    dead girls’ dresses, I wore dresses I found  on the shore, in now-empty homes  I wore the sun  I wore the muddy water that carried my neighbor’s bodies  I wore the boat that rose up to become a mountain  I wore the bodies of beached dolphins  I wore washed up Chinese newspapers  I wore melon crates  I wore a government hand-out blanket  I wore the unclaimed backpack of an elementary school boy  I wore my great grandmother’s lost tablet  I wore the names of my classmates, etched in my arm  I wore altars to washed away gods  I wore a uniform from another city  I wore my father  I wore the smile expected of daughters  I wore the dead girls whose dresses I stole  I wore the kappa I sometimes feel against my ankle,  trying to pull me into the water  I wore driftwood  I wore a new gospel in my shoes  and got dressed for the ocean.       Let us now speak of The Gig of Light.    Let us speak as the buzz of bulbs, brilliantly or  vividly intoned as old-timers’ concert flashbacks.    Let our memoir-a-thon glitter and flit,  firefly in the face–vs–flash-in-the pan.    Let us speak long of The Gig of Light.    How we held the retina in a dazzle—  how we zapped the sun up for a second,  how we shocked with watts,  and perfect resolution.    Oh, The Gig of Light! The Gig of Light!    How we shimmered  aurora-like and arousing,  how we glowed  green-blue and crisp,  how we flickered  meaningfully or with menace—    How we streaked across the screen  and were seen no more. We drank the nectar left there for you.  We grew drunk on doom.    There was never enough.    Down by the river of our youth,  we pulled love with our tongues.    We took something from you.    Green-groping in reeds and stink,  river slow in its drive-by saw us,    said nothing. We could say  we were young—young was once true.    We took all that was sweet and all that would be.  We left no excuse.    We ignored the body-made call, the sweet text,  its subtle, alien speech:    We beseeched! We beseeched!  Did you not get our message?  It tasted of many grasses drunk:  clover bud, sepal, petals—  then panic, then wrath, then the end .    All that we read,  we misread:    Come hither, help us! Come-come!    Did you not get enough?  Taste in the grass, be drunk —  Taste many times over, taste more,  taste in hurry, in passion,  taste to the end of all tongues and be done. In Florida, it seems the sun stays out longer  than where I’m from. I have come here    to escape clay, brick. My father taught  the boy I am with to be less like his mother.    The boy buys me a virgin strawberry daiquiri.  We walk together on the beach. Feet in the cool sand,    the cling of fabric to skin, a sudden awareness  of distance— this is ritual. I make a worship    for the sand, pour my drink out. The waves  eat it and the thousand handkerchiefs    I have brought with me, confessed to them.  The boy runs through the waves, is eaten in various ways.    He runs back, slick with night water. I have tricked  myself into thinking he loves me. He loves    his mother, her bottles. Lord, we are young.  We pass couples folded into each other    and into the sand. The bastard pier comes into view.  We turn around, walk towards the hotel.   His mother is waiting in her driftwood  palace. I imagine she is drunk like the first two nights,    hair splayed over the couch like seaweed. My father  is not here to teach the boy. The boy is not here    to teach me to pray to the gods of this beach,  that moon, but he does anyway.    He is not like his mother. He is drunk  on things untouchable. In the end    we are dry, bone-white, blasted  into the night like newborn suns.  As a kid, I found my dad’s gun  rusted and collecting dust behind  his framed diploma, atop a bookshelf,    a summer afternoon spent at his house,  snooping around while he was away at work.  When I asked him about it he said    he was walking home from a party  in the Bronx when two shadows  jumped out of an alley, shoved    a gun in his face and demanded  he empty his pockets. But when  the streetlight’s glow fell on his face    they noticed not the terror in his eyes  but rather his Caribbean curls  in a neat fro, his dark goosebumped skin,    and backed off, said oh, sorry papo.  One of them gave him a pat on the shoulder  before slipping back into the alley.    The next day he bought a gun,  unregistered, illegal, but wore it  everywhere he went just in case,    tucked into the waistline of his pants  even when he was taking classes  at City College and wore a full suit:    blue pants and jacket, white shirt,  red tie, black shoes he shined  every morning, trying to reflect    the success he knew was possible  in this country, and didn’t really think  much of the gun after a while, until    one night, coming home from school  later than usual he found himself alone  in the compartment of an uptown train,    reading the newspaper. At the stop  before his, a band of five guys rushed  into the car, one of them hiding    something under his jacket, holding it  like a pregnant belly. My dad reached for his gun,  let his hand touch the cold metal    as the hand of a police officer  stopped the doors from closing,  stepped onto the train with his partner    and an old, silver haired woman who pointed  at everyone and confirmed with the officers  that yes, they were the ones who stole her purse.    As they put the guys in cuffs, one of the officers  glanced at my dad— who hadn’t moved,  looking guiltier than anyone,    hand still frozen under his jacket,  sweat darkening his collar—  and shook his head as if to say    can you believe these guys? My dad  smiled back and bolted off the train,  thinking about deportation, or worse,    sprinting the few extra blocks home  in the cold, under streetlights casting  their long fingered shadows.  Midnight sun of the red blazing “O”  in the window, a beacon for wanderers  looking to escape the cold, or thrown-out  drunks trying to keep the night-talk alive  until morning arrives like an express train,  because the coffee refills here are free.  The undergrad who works the graveyard  shift lets them loiter, but has to remind  them every single night that if they want  a refill, they have to buy a cup of coffee first. Back in her childhood bedroom, she can’t decide what to pack – the Tom Petty and Elvis records, her ticket stubs from American Idol? Ancient icons – the flag, her baton, her majorette costume – seem less useful now than Tupperware, aspirin, Bactine and Band-Aids. She longed for her mother to tell her once again what to do – not to wear her bangs too long, or her skirt too short. Not to wear too much lipstick. She was thankful for her lessons from summer camp – cooking eggs in a skillet over a fire, learning to shoot a shotgun at seven, and her aim was still true despite skinny arms. She could still sing the Star Spangled Banner with the best of them. Beneath the wild eyes of her faded toy horses, the blank grey faces of dead television sets, she dreams once more of a little more life, somewhere else. She ties the laces of her rollerblades tight, determined for once to do much more than survive. I knew I was home when I walked down a path of decaying leaves, through a bridge of tree limbs. You couldn’t even drive on this path that led me home. That made sense as I’d always liked the country, the far-awayness and difficulty of it, the chance of your neighbor pulling a gun on you or on another neighbor, the chance that the smoke in the air was someone burning leaves or maybe burning their house down for the insurance. Yes, that’s my idea of home – picking around the remains of someone’s burned-down house for the chance of finding really good wild strawberries there, little patches of violets, the trinkets of divestment. You never get lonely in the woods. I’ve never been frightened of bears, they left me alone, or the birds. There’s the comfort of the knocking on hollow branches, the scratching song of insects, and those tubes of sunlight that show up on the path, lighting the way. How the stone wouldn’t break open for the girls in their bodies brand new to the world, tender squeal the sound babies made on their way from night-trees to the arms of mother, blue lipped with the last prayer, choked like coyotes with bones of pups they offered buzzards—how stones wouldn’t and honey wouldn’t, nor blood, so girls spun shadow and the other side of devils made sounds of death-heads taking in dark, mother of light—god how stones cannot give and in hiding, heal. I saw a brace of mountain like  spotted, black & white horses  clopping down the dusty road  through clouds of powdered clay    The abandoned train tracks cleaved into woods  What loneliness tilled from my mind  fallen pine needles etched on the tracks  I watched them gleam—bright countries I’d never visit    Even my imagination excavates silence  Even my imagination is lonely  & then a reprieve, it was summer  The smell of clay & the bees I killed with my hands. The cheesesteak I cooked for him,  Like biting through steel , he said.  I want to live another five years  so the grandkids can remember me .  I saw photos on Facebook at Tres Magaritas,  his cheeks a mine, excavated,  his smile stilled by the camera.  It has been a year—over a year!—  since the suits, shirts, and shoes  given away to close friends,  since the casseroles, late night tea.  His eight-minute drive  he took for decades to NCAR,  right turns on Heidelberg,  Lehigh and Table Mesa  became frontiers and scouts  for the Civil War,  his hospital room,  a rundown mountain hotel.  My son swipes through photos  on my phone. Grandad , he says.  The sharks swim in a luminous  blue glass taller than his outstretched arms.  I can still smell the peat  from the Lagavulin we drank together,  his oak and hay cough, his heavy pour,  like the magazine renewal emails  I get from the New Yorker  long after his death.  I want to email those fucks back  and say it was a Christmas gift,  you fuck, he’s dead I can’t buy him  another year for sixty percent off. The summer my stepfather was out of the country his white & cream Stratocaster, rumored to be a Jimi Hendrix, glared like an apparition in the studio apartment; the Formica table defiant in its whiteness, my older sister stood on it, barefoot, cuts on her legs from all those showers with a loofah, screaming get that thing away from me, it’s trying to kill me, as our Siberian Husky barked, its bark vibrating into quiet eternity, but my laugh, my laugh at her paranoia was shame showing itself in the odd ways it appeared; the table, after she got down, cleaned by my mother with an overused green rag, the smell of dirt like gasoline; I was raped too, a knife at my neck in the Village, when I was around your age; I kept my head down, drinking grape juice; I never spoke to Ma or my sister about what men do to women, but I swore to see my own manhood as bestial; we ate Dinty Moore Beef Stew & Hungryman dinners, I sat by Ma, her feet next to me, my back against the leg of the couch & we watched Mr. Belvedere; I scrubbed the floor with mop water & a sponge after dinner, the dust swirled in the light.        I guess you’ve heard that swans are violent creatures. Reptile-shapes that fell asleep in the snow and woke up shining. So I don’t have to tell you that when I was young, I was attacked by a swan, large and screaming, white as an egg. It was nesting season, thick spring, pink jelly raindrops alighting in the pond nearby. The swan rose before me, marshmallow soft, neck twisting like taffy, took my dark wings in its black beak and tore.     Eyes fell from my feathers, scattered like pearls. It swallowed all but two like hard candy. The swan ripped me open, dug golden dust from behind my ribs, swallowed my second heart still-beating. It licked the blue fur from my body, left me naked as a shucked oyster. Its white wings darked the sky.     The swan opened my body and filled me with eggs, shells cracking, yolk into blood. Then sewed my thorax shut with spiderweb strands of honey. The swan became a cloud. Left my body bleeding in the sweet and sticky rain. And this, you know, is how girls are made. I.    Example: the white teacher who calls schools  in Detroit riotous because the kids  behave, he says, like beehives.    Or when your auntie said don’t be scared  of the bees. They know when you’re afraid  but really they are more afraid of you. They  will kill themselves trying to defend their own.    II.    I am no more a beast when I bare my teeth  than when the lioness abandons any cub  she decides not worthy.    We are all beasts. Some of us choose  not to be afraid of remembering. i didn’t               think    i could                whimper  like a dog –                                  tears and snot  dripping             toward the drain  between gasps.                             i shake  against                the curve of tub.    the faucet drips –  knob broken.  stop. stop .  worms fill  the tub –             rising like water.  they burrow under                       my skin.    they aren’t                        real. they aren’t  real but still i wonder           why  even a worm    would want  to be in               this        body.    *    i’m jealous of infants  who haven’t developed  object permanence yet:  a toy, face can disappear  behind couch, hands.    but the baby boy isn’t  the only one to know  when someone in the family  is gone indefinitely. he knows  how often we die here,  how common the causes.    *    keep telling me what isn’t  real—my fear unfounded,  trauma ignorable, no time  to mourn, dying to become    dead like racism is dead .    *    the child finds an earthworm  on the sidewalk in front of  his house after the rain. he  prods it, remembers hearing  at school from another kid  how a worm split in half will  become two worms. he digs  into its center with long nail  until it becomes two, watches  to see it writhe with twice  as much life as before.    *    these thousands               of pink bodies  filling this ovoid space:  the worms         around my legs  squirm faster. they say  there’s no air      down here .  the worms on top say  there’s plenty.        you’re fine.   we’re all in the same tub.    *    older, the boy is online and sees  a video of a man with his face  pressed into ground. he thinks  it may be harder to see the dirt  layered on our faces but it doesn’t  mean it’s not there . he sees the man  squirm under the pinning of uniformed  arms. he wishes the man could free  himself by splitting in two. he wishes  the man’s severed neck could have  become two men, twice as thriving,  rising into the sun after the storm.    *    lying in bed    i feel one  of the worms     in my ear,  want to stab it.    tell me the worm           isn’t real:    it won’t stop      the knife  from being metal, sharp. God, I believe you when you say I’ve fallen short but I’m not sure about being wonderfully made. Maybe God isn’t always as honest as they are jealous, though who am I for any creator to want my life dedicated to them? My worst nightmares end in me being alive. The first time I visited a friend’s home in a nicer neighborhood    When I think about / Detroit    I think about black friends / who looked more foreign    to me than Aiden / or Michael or Brian or Ryan    and the other kindergartners / who lived    on the other side / of the school    I think about how I never / until college    saw a black person / play soccer    how at Aiden’s house / his sister cried    when we tried to play soccer / because    Aiden kicked the ball / into her shin    (unintentionally / I assume)    and it ricocheted off his knee / hitting her shin twice    and before: when she said / we shouldn’t play    without shin guards / just in case    and after: when I thought to say / but didn’t say    to both him / and to myself    don’t apologize: / how could you    have known / it would result in this?        When I think about / Detroit    I see / Aiden’s sister’s    tears / can’t remember  her voice / see myself    leaving / at eighteen    for the suburbs / I must keep saying    to myself again / and again this guilt    alone / changes nothing. Dear eggs sliding down plates at midnight a longing in the pit of my stomach. Dear dollar store frying pan nonstick surface in each egg I made because I needed something to fill me. Dear me with my underwear down in the town square after midnight with a guy because I could. Dear finding out at midnight our childhood friend was dead. Gone. All of us elsewhere. How could we be there. How could a lake of half-life already she was dead. Dear dance class teacher who knew how to pick her out she had the body. Dear almost prima ballerina dear pink leotard crumpled up and dirty and dear number not in service. Dear body and opal ring missing. Dear place and wet and forget this place. Dear midnight in centuries of the myth of wolf. Dear what’s a wolf of instinct nothing broken in glass. Dear drifting and the killer called for the weather forecast after her death. Dear daughter waking a mind of whiteout. Your daughter. Your panting. Dear daughter with no future. Dear I’m almost home for the holidays what is this. Dear future slipped and corroded. Dear parents. Who can enter sleep now as a bird the banks of the lake made of bars. Dear two sets of footprints. Dear only one. Dear lips where sediment accumulates. Dear distance and serving. Dear all over this space I can’t find you. Dear eggs inside of us depleting and then gone. Dear what does anything teach us about stillness. Dear dream I keep having of red sand on the floor of her car the sand from the lake underneath the fingernails. Wash of cold water finally on my back or just the river  I remember sticking my ankles in and finally dirt flaking    water drift inside my mind now, as if thoughts leaked  water, rare flowers, or rather now leaking what’s so    normal, taking out the trashcan to the curb every Monday  morning. I see a leaf enclosing around this squirrel’s fist.    My hound hunts for baby crackers dropped by my daughter  in the front yard, their camellia texture on his tongue,    and the air from the neighbor’s mower, wind-flower, grass and how  much pollen again will yellow our feet. How to separate    my domestic urge and the one of the north-wind I’ll call it,  county fairs with prizes selected I knew I could win if I just    tried hard enough and nothing to lose. Some of the light creeps  and is on everything you could lose now. Or that’s the way    I want it, angling to keep nothing on my back but everything  already is. Some wear their intimate thoughts and kind gestures    in the face. I wear them on this front lawn today. I don’t really care  what the neighbors say. I love their sprinklers anyway and will bask    my feet in them. My daughter strips and sits in water. The treasure  of a mind is cast out before I can touch it. Drawn garden-ward and    sea-ward I want right here, thoughts that flow like water into land  a tale I could sit and tell my daughter. On this day. That I would    take her and make her a frigid statue out of a tale, make beautiful  space and line, and somehow figure out how to polish an inaccessible    shrine, a making of my own, a day, this one, rare squirrel-wet breath,  whatever collides today, let it tell something about what we urge.    *some language from H.D.’s “Wash of Cold River” I.  I ran from the sermon screaming  or I walked up the aisle  each of the parishioners’ eyes falling upon me—  the pastor paused—  I punched his face—I dug my nails  into my arms to chase away these thoughts and tried to breathe  under the weight  like stones piled on my sternum.    The pastor resumed, explaining that King Saul  wasn’t crazy. An evil spirit  sent by the Lord descended upon him for  waiting only seven days, as asked, and for showing mercy.    At brunch, an old family friend said  Mental illness is a symptom of faithlessness.  If you want to be sane, better get yourself saved.  I understood my affliction: possession.  I needed to pray each night,  to repent, to read the Bible,  to read that before Moses returned to the Nile,  the Lord had said I will harden Pharaoh’s heart,  so he will not let the people go .  The Lord had promised the death of the first born.    The compulsion to run out of church mid-service  was not a warning                   but a command.    II.    In the decade since, I’ve learned doubt,  I’ve learned to recognize the symptoms  of a panic attack.  The flesh remembered  what I tried to forget.    After Sunday school, a girl tackled me as I left the bathroom.  At seven I couldn’t fight off a middle-school attacker.  Pinned to the ground,  my hand shoved against my nose.  She yelled,  It smells like shit!  Wash your hands!    It didn’t matter what I said  about my hygiene, she knew I was unclean.    The whole Sunday school class—faces like angels—laughed. A body of wound threads, I resign to him, for this is routine when I must lose my breaths to the morning bind, an aubade to the stuff of me that grips too tightly. I allow his arrangements – an armature erected, painted by silk and hemp. Hanging desires: the sweet of torque, the defiance of gravity, (the paralysis I always resisted). Hazel in Room 224 stops me, says she knows  I’m not her granddaughter, but loves    me anyway, reaches to lipstick my cheek,  her teeth caked pink, a baby bird mouth    opening and closing as I pass by. Next  door, you think it is Sunday and we are    on an island, your long-dead father in the corner  salmon scales on his fingers and work boots    stiff with sap. Everyone I know knocks  but won’t enter. I’ve buried you a dozen times    this way: smiled at cafeteria cashiers, sorted  through sacks of personal effects, found myself    holding keys with locks that can’t be found.  You’ve been following the path of trappers,    naked in the snow-starred night, sending messages  into space, recording the secret longing of trees.    Everyone I know asks questions I can’t answer,  ushers me toward a westward running torrent    without the comfort of a firm bank. I’ve exhumed  you a hundred times this way: rivers that once    built an empire fall toward the ocean, rust grows  thick and somewhere, somewhere, somewhere    pilings make shadows, stand still as the water rises  because it is all they know to do. I fear masked men. Cloaked  cheeks, mouth hidden, eyes peering.  Ski mask or wrapped scarf, I tremble, my gut drops.    Brother’s murderers wore night  as a cloak. Collars turned up. Hats cast down into the dark  of eyes.    Recite the night.  I rouse Brother from sleep.  He exits the blue door almost naked,  except for boxers and slippers.    There are so many shadows here.  At first, Rain mutes danger. I wear a sloppy sweatshirt,  brain and instincts dull from sleep and Rain’s steady rhythm.  I enter this memory hoping for a clue, some  new understanding or to relive Last Moment with Brother–  Last Moment, whole.    But then there is Bullet. Then there is fear.  Explain–the ways it electrifies my tongue. I slip in and out.  I lick fear, spilling from my mouth into a howl when a  man on bus slips on ski mask.  He is not right. He stares and slinks. His grace uneases me.  I must grip something.    Learn this guilt. Days I am Lost Cause.  My body a burden I do not want.  Sometimes I want to tell everyone  who will listen that those men killed a part of me too.    They turned me jukebox,  I only know one song;  a haunted tune of the hunted.    My body does what it does. I need this. To understand  how I confuse Past and Present. I go searching the library  for answers. But Bullet only brings questions.    Living with the Unanswerable and Missing;  I learn joy after Bullet.    Cracking open. Buzzing salty with  indulgence. A brightness almost forgotten.  I stir it with the tip of a finger,  it teaches me to order a man to his knees.  Find the command in my voice.  There’s a strength here. I wear it like new skin.  We both like it. In these moments fear disappears.    Don’t tell me why.  Don’t pathologize this unexpected  pleasure. I.    In the wrong teeth, my name is a litany  of broken things. A dangerous music  thrumming in the distance, and I, thirsty  bird at a kind man’s closed window come back  and back. Call me slack-keyed. Call me quick-  silvered beauty. My Dead sing to me  from the Book of Night. Sing of the salt-grit  girl, barefoot, wandering the lost city.  Past the clock tower’s lit face anguished  in the river, past the low bridges and still  something in her begins to grow restless.  From the blueprints of her voice, I have built  a cobblestone woman. Hear them whisper—  rooms inside myself I dare not enter.      II.    Rooms inside myself I dare not enter  beckon me Come in . I am a broken  bell of yes . I am an arrowless quiver.  What I mean to say is I know I’m home  by my leaving it. What I mean to say  is don’t let me go. See how I splinter  when the light hits just so! I want to take  my shoes off. I want to swim in the river.  My body is a cobblestone city.  There are riots in the streets. Take my hand ,  says the man with compass lips. He kisses me  and I know where I am. Kisses me and  I’m not sure I was ever here at all.  Loneliness is a name I call and call.      III.    Loneliness is a name I call and call  until it becomes my own. January  spreads its gnarled fingers like a trawl  through the muted streets. I was born in a city  of echoes. I was born in a room made  entirely of blue mornings. They live  in me still. I will know myself by name  when the sparrows flee my lungs. I’d give  my voice for the music of frantic wings.  Tell me I’m not merely a box of mirrors,  but a fix, the slow unclenching  of a phantom limb. Listen: Here is  my blue song. My blue hands, their blue shiver.  They pulled a blue girl from the river.      IV.    I pulled a blue girl from the river.  I have been ripping her, night after night,  from the dark currents of my hunger.  The Book says everyone in my dream-life  is a shadow of myself. Each face, my own.  Stone by stone, the world sunken in me.  The Book says to die is like coming home.  Blue hands around our blue throat. How sweet  the breath that knows not what’s coming next.  The Book says it’s better not to question  the opening door. My name is a secret  waiting for the right mouth to nest in.  Swallow the river until the guilt runs clear.  Promise me there are no saviors here.      V.    Trust me—there are no saviors here, where  the wind breaks itself against a body  in order to be heard and my want spares  nothing in the dark. My Dead leave me  to my own devices. I wear my  vices like a barbed wire dress. Look how  I whittle regret into something I  can carry on my back. Call me hollow-  bellied. Call me Namer of Things I Used  to Be, all the versions of myself I’ve shed  through the bluest cities—small gods who bruise  their wrists with prayer, who wait for their own dead  to find them. Small gods, all of us, in this need.  Has there always been winter in me?      VI.    There has always been winter in me.  A white silence. Errant bloom. I, who kneel  at the edges where the tamed grow wild with grief.  I, who must blue my flesh to know I’m real.  My Dead remind me I am more than my bones.  Take me down to where the river offers  itself to the sea. Take me back to the stones  that know my toes by heart. To the waters  I give back the girl. To the girl I give back  my hands, now fevered with March. I cup her face  in spring: sweet orange and honey and lilac  unhinging. I lift my mouth to the cruel grace  of the living and drink. Steel-tongued, I wake  with my hair loose and my new skin ripe with ache.      VII.    With my hair loose and my new skin ripe with ache  I take my two good hands and tear down  the clock tower with its ghost-ridden face.  I pull the honeycomb from my throat, drown  the bees in the river. I listen long  enough to the thick and voiceless static  to know my Dead will never finish their song.  I lay my old name in the reeds, a basket  I weigh down with stones. Goodbye to the room  of blue mornings. Goodbye to the city  of ruin I draped around me like a tomb.  Let winter’s recessional flood the streets  with relief. Please god, let a kind army  of teeth echo my name into litany. What were you wearing?    Thirst in the belly. Was it  a ripeness? Too blue  oceans for eyes to hide  the drought in me. A mouth.    How much did you have to drink?    I reached into the darkness  and it reached back. Firewater.  Gasoline. My good, good shame.    Did you know them?     It’s just us, babe. A dry drowning.  All that thirst.    Why did you get in the car with them that night?    Rust on the tongue. Palm  on the nape. A carnival  game. Keep your eye  on the small object. Quick  which cup is it?    Did you say no? Did you fight?    One smelled of snuffed out  matches. One’s skin scrubbed  inside like the pool table lining.  My feet are slashed tires.  One wore my mouth  like a repossession.    What were you wearing?    The pink stain of every pretty name  they hung from my body. Puliendo el paso, por toda la calle real.  Polishing as she steps, all along the royal street.    Siempre esta en mi Corazon ,  she says this to me.  Rolls te quiero mucho from her  tongue and I am broken.    I don’t know that she knows  that  I am broken.    That mi dama was polished  before I understood what polished  meant.    That I was dropped and swept up  by the busted broom  of mi familia.    That somewhere between the swig  of a Budweiser and the turn of the  tomo todo top, I was falling.    Vanishing from every shelf.  The white shelf.  The Mexican shelf.  The little girl shelf.  The innocent shelf.  The shelf of sexuality,   I hadn’t mastered yet.    My pieces are everywhere.  A Kaleidoscope of misunderstood identity.    Hello, my name is not in a box.    Hello, my name is not chicana or guera, queer  or maricón .  My name is not shelved.  It’s in the dustpan of her hands and I’ve been molded.  She whispers, te quiero mucho and I am broken.  I,            am broken.   Hola, mi nombre es roto . Yo soy de rota. Not often have I tasted ceremony, but I remember  taking orders from an Indian named Snowbear,  who, as darkness flooded our 8th grade campout,  tied us to trees with thread he dared us not to snap,  and I won the bet, motionless while millipedes  poked me like fingers from the grave, silent  when he called game over , a wild thing openly hiding,  silent and brave and still even as his boots  trampled through fallen leaves with steps  that sounded like brush fire; Outward Bound,  but I thought I was a Native child, and I have tried  to return to that day when I lingered between worlds,  but instead I am a gawker in the Florida Parishes  where it’s never quite safe–sunset, for example,  through the pine trees’ bristles, is just  a fire with teeth, and there is fire everywhere–  burn piles, brush fires, smoke pits stuffed with boar,  lazy fires set in paint cans on purpose and left  unsupervised for the firefighters find, only  they themselves are–how shall I say it–lackadaisical-  lite on water, heavy on wait-and-see, meanwhile  the woods consume themselves, while down the road  the meth lab rages, that took the boy and his father  who entered the inferno after him, and almost certainly  too late, the soft bellies of Fire District #12 rolled in;  short on hydrants and sleep, they hauled water  in tanks that Houdini in his straight jacket  would have aimed for, and it was magic they needed,  or a miracle, but only morning answered, along with smoke  speaking its language of the snake, yet within six months  the dump trucks delivered mounds of red clay,  and like that the earth was on fire again, which is how  the Choctaw and Tchefuncte pre-fabbed Louisiana,  by hauling woven baskets of earth to add a shoulder  or a wrinkle or spoked wheel, making sacred spaces  for us to desecrate, because we forget who came before,  and we always hate the ones who come after us,  for the change they bring, their unfamiliar dust,  their army of surveyors applying machetes  to the tender undergrowth, claiming another rancid slab  of swamp for a housewife with paint chip dreams;  does she know about the fire, the teddy bear shrine,  that the boy continues, stalled at three years old,  how I can almost see him in footy pajamas, pouting,  dragging his sooty blanket down the garden path  of the new house where new children scream and kick  at the sky on their swing set, fresh-stained cedar  anchored in a mound where the meth lab used to be,  where he lay mute until his dreams smoked out,  beside his father who went back in after him–  each drive-by it’s a different nightmare, but always  the trees lean in, their lesser branches charred.       Tammany Parish KKK   Martin Luther King Day, 2016   All those baggies  filled with sand  and open invitations  to the brotherhood  of Loyal White Knights–  they’ve been erased.  Your labor’s undone. Confiscated.  Lily-livered, anonymous,  hooded ones, sneaking around  at the snail’s hour—at least  snails set down filigree trails.  You cruise country roads  laying the bricks of hate.  One per house, as far  as I walked with the dog.  Discarding your handiwork  would have been too easy,  so I repurposed the leaflets  into origami cranes.  I brought them to the Bogue Falaya  and set them sailing  past the cypress trees,  harmless and pure as doves. I am always lost in a desert. If there is sand or dust, I am on my knees begging to start an honest life  with rain. In delirium, I kill a swordfish, use its silver skin as a blindfold against the dust. I have never wanted  to see beauty or the blisters of a hero’s journey. I made these mountains unmerciful – full of fire, venom, thorn.  How can you say god without garlic in your mouth? What kind of god will let his name live in an abscessed throat?  In a lemon grove, there is enough fruit to start a new sky, yellow globes littering their own light. I am holding hell  in my bowels and there is a map that shows how to get there: go down, go down, go down. On the highway, women hail  cars and offer their suffering as pleasure. What alchemy, what cherished recipes. I do not know an Aphrodite or Hestia  that wouldn’t give up her myth to be a scar on my thigh. The men, they are busy scything the wheat’s hair and this is  the greatest hurt I let them know. Come to god, come through the flat churchyard, the holy cave, the lava flow, the ruin.  Worship is a crypt where your body will last. This life is sulpher and peasantry, a barren land that mirrors the mind. The Madonna  cries because god is a castle where no one stays. If you draw trinacrias in the dirt, I will trust that you have hunger beyond your figs.  If you run towards me on three legs, I will dedicate an entire famine to your loneliness, your centaurs, your radiant godless fate. When a child hears gunshots, she will say Mom is beating the pots and pans . She will say  It sounds like home . Let’s keep it this way; our children misinterpreting the sound of dying as a crude percussion. When they kneel at their beds and ask god where he was when their best friend stopped being alive he will say  I was at the drive-thru ,  I was so hungry I thought the gunshots were my stomach begging for food . He will say I know nothing until strangers tell me about it first, I could have bullet wounds in my hands and I’d know nothing about what hurts and doesn’t hurt. What a god; making the world out of variations of madness, refusing to hold its face in his hands and saying You,  you are mine . It is not ours: the young blood, the unfinished drawings, the last blurry thoughts before a world goes black. When god is busy wiping grease from his mouth, we can stand in a line with the dead in our backpacks, next to our pencils and our snacks; he won’t notice when we give the whole damned world back.        In a dream I stab myself in the face with a toy sword  I’m on a bus and hope no one else on the bus can see me as I inch the sword out of my body  I babysit a child who is actually a doll covered in glitter  and I’m bad at it.  A man stands at a podium and tells the crowd that my father  is a rapist and a criminal and not their best. Objectively true:  Not The Best.  I am making a list of ways your fathers have wronged me. I am reading the list on a bus and no one can see me. me: slowly dying from smoke inhalation.   you: a ghost  me: seeking someone, anyone to bring me a smoothie spinach, plain yogurt, strawberry, extra pineapple just like shove a whole pineapple in there  and blend it up with some ice   you:  a literal pineapple  me: calling my mom, saying I am so exhausted emotionally, but also the regular way, like it’s so heavy and,   you: drinking coffee from a teacup,  floating  in the pool  me: drinking   you, accidentally participating in an immersive ad experience   you: a guide to facing my demons   the other definition of alien is always   the first one you’ll remember  me: a demon   you: also a demon, ready to be faced  me: in love with fucked up fake alien cultures   you: there is always something new     that sounds likes your snores, like wolves   on tv made in a sound room or construction   crews with chainsaws or the cat’s snores or   another sound  me: a chainsaw   you: m4m  me: a ghost G-d of toddler wobble & teen sweat, of bride’s lace  & belly quake, cradle my newborn cry beside my love.    G-d of new bruises & blood loss, You grew these cells.  Let tears petition boundless eyes to cry beside my love!    G-d of transplant & graft, of transfusion & mask,  spare me this task. Will no star rise beside my love?    No G-d cracked his gene & grew this rebel protein.  Who hacks his counts? Who sucks time beside my love?    Devil of no sleep.  Devil of dawn needle & night  shakes. A devil IV snakes beside my love.    Devil of dumb mutation. Stomach devil. Tongue devil.  A beeping breathing devil machine dies beside my love.    No devil brought him back today.  He stayed in the sheets  & did not rise with the sun. G-d, how I cried beside my love.        Your girlfriend breaks up with you  in a dream because you can’t keep  the sheets kicking like you used to.  You wake at the pink light of dawn  over a mountain that is not home.    Your girlfriend is home in the city  asleep with your dogs and your sheets  that smell of four years together, no matter  how vigorously you wash them. She wears  her old blue sweatpants and her breath is    as it always is at dawn. You are hours away  taking care of your art and she is, as usual,  caring for everything else. In this antebellum  house it is so quiet your brain jumbles thought  into everything and nothing at once. In the dream,    you thought the two of you finally found  that spark again. But she pulled back  into the dark sticky matter of imagination  that you’ll never again be able to reach.  You sat naked on the bed and it was also    a kitchen. She was into you—one hand on  your inner thigh, finger barely tempting  neglected lips—and distracted. You ruin  the moment by making it therapy so she calls  her Navy friend to come pick her up. Let’s    hang out, she asks and there he is  with a bottle of whiskey. You reach  for her, swear you’ll shut your mouth,  but now you’re at brunch without money  and there are dogs tied up across the street.    They are about to pull away from their leashes. Bright kitchen table. Nags Head, North Carolina.  One of very few family vacations. Before little brother.    Before half-brothers stopped coming to stay.  White tile floor. In a high chair, dangling chubby    thighs and toddler feet like it’s the best thing.  Hi-C juice box in hand. The boys at the table.    The ocean waits for us to finish our lunch.  Dad smokes on the porch, or looks out and sighs    at the sea. Mom’s in that blue-leopard ruffled  one-piece to hide what she thought was lingering    post-me fat. Her long hair in the side French-braid  she always wore. Our happiness here still vulnerable    to light under the kitchen table, light pouring in  from the sliding glass doors to the sand dunes    and the rickety wooden fence to the Atlantic and sky.  The light, true. Mom’s happiness true, too, our young    family without boundary, or fortune. I squeeze  too hard. Pink splashes the chair and floor. Perhaps this    is the beginning, my first yes to the just do it  in my rebellious bones. See what happens.    I love this urge—the test, the gush, the spilling over  out of straws, jeans, bodies, mouths. The messes    we make. I squeeze again, already high on too far.  O the primal surprise when I hear, “Tara, stop it.    I said, stop !” I’m unclear of no and its partner,  guilt. The better world shut for me. This dimension    I still flirt toward, where we squeeze what we want to squeeze  to see what happens, then celebrate it. Where mom squeezes    back and we all laugh and roll around naked  in the sugary-stick of what is spilled and its reflection. A house of crickets singing through papery walls.  Refugees, single mothers. We come to change our luck.  I spent a year attempting our separation, proving something and nothing. I gave in.  That one bedroom I shared with my son so his father and I did it on the floor until  we conceived another. I chose it—  place of towering sycamores. Whatever caused sap to move, changed winter bark from gray to ice-white,  I needed it. House of thin sliding glass, house of pollen and vine.  My courtyard luscious from the seeds I buried.  I spoke to what made my moonflowers bloom:  Hold steady against the sad  smoke of others, the complaints of cars— it all creeps past the threshold’s gap.  Help me to change my insides, direct my damp shoes,  you who guide the beetle that crosses my floor. My love disappears  around a corner of yellow  streetlamp.    Engaged with his phone,  someone speaks as he walks  into the night and his native streets.    Nothing but dogs and radios  through everyone’s iron-barred windows.    I want to run and follow, but won’t.  I sit on the concrete, my bare legs  mosquito bitten.    In a dip of quiet,  a man’s voice rises.  A woman’s voice rises back.    The dogs begin again.    A constant wind from the mountain  combs over my worry    but my love returns quick,  offers his hand to lift  my body and the moon it carries.    Then he looks to sky, away.    Already from the window  someone is calling his name. I dreamed of trees with blue veins in a forest full of wilting. And there, all my southern girl self, full of No thank yous ,  full of You first and Go ahead and have the last piece of cake .  I want that that last piece of cake. Dreamed the trees made me my own torte, and I could have the whole thing.  My sisters, the trees, they said Come now, sit, eat .  They had blue veins in the forest full of wilting, and I cried. There were no forks. They said my hands were fork enough.  And when I tried to say please , the trees said my eyes  were please , and they said my mouth was thank you , and the trees cried too. They had beautiful eyes  for crying. A color I had never seen. So, I named it   Godlovesyoureyesbecauseshemadethemthisbeautifulcolor . Now anyone who ever saw the color would think of the trees  and the meaning of the trees, which was to be. As it turns out, I was the party  waiting to happen, and my mother,    she was the corridor to the clubhouse,  narrow and occult, filled with the scent of light.    I broke the kingdom inside her, broke the gala  of horses straining to get out. I broke the dancehall    mirrors and even the gilded faucet handles.  I was a river that strong. Made for flooding.    On the other side, the game had already started:  The family-in-waiting hot in a match of Scrabble.    I broke the letters, broke the game  board, broke, with my cry, the need for    speech. Only the nurse knew what to say: Here,  Love, placing me at my mother’s breast. In    The Book of Letters, Rabbi Kushner says  the OTIYOT exist independent of ink or paper    or words, says when Moses shattered the first  set of tablets, the letters ascended    to The One Who Gave Them. So, this is how  we arrive in this life: already letting go, mystical    as the ALEF-BEIT, independent of mothers, fathers  and bodies, casting our own incomprehensible,    immortal spells—flying back, already flying back  into the feathery, hollow-boned throat of God. Say, comforting your daughter when she skins her knee.  I bundle her into my lap, gather her teary face against mine, rock and rock, my lips at her little flower of ear. Blood bright against her pale leg  reminds me, while I wait for her to quiet, of rats accustomed to feasting on bamboo fruit who in years of famine eat instead their own soft pink young.  Is it a mishap like this— blood spilled—that prompts those mothers to take the first taste? How neat an urge—at last, a task with a clear end, and afterwards, sleep. Body untethered. Noise and need transformed to protein and silence. Chance to start new.  Whether I think about this or not, my overripe body nests my child. She wails, then wails more softly, sniffs. You  say how tender this is. My skin can comfort, no matter what I imagine. You call that tender. I call that terrible power.                All summer I washed clothes in the sink, worried  to lose them in the communal pile of laundry    la doña would throw on the couch for us to sort.  I’d write down anything I placed in the basket—    blue cat pajama pants , yellow daisy skirt .  But I never gave her my black clothes, afraid    they would fade grey drying on the Spanish rooftop.  I washed those by hand—    the black jeans, black shorts, black long skirt  with the bleach-stained hem, black tank top,    black strapless bra that he took off  while parked on the empty fairgrounds at 7AM, black    polished nails on the dashboard,  black pupil, freckle, black    thong on the carpet, black  blood on the leather, on the sand walking home.         There are days she tells me it’s grown since I’ve moved,  the freckle above my left brow. You taught me    how to make it bigger, I say, remembering  my mother’s face close to the mirror,    mornings before church, brown pencil in hand  filling in the mole above her lip.    There was a day I was born upside-down,  speck left over on my forehead,    the only bare lip to inherit her blood.  There were days I’d take a crayon to my face,    play god, create pigment where it didn’t exist.  There were days she would sing Cielito Lindo,    Ay ay ay ay, to her reflection.  There were days I would beg, Mamí,    bésame como la novela , asking for the frenzy  kiss of Juan Carlos and his mistress that I saw her watch on TV    while she folded my cotton briefs.  There were days, I wanted her hands at the base of my neck,    wanted to toss my head side to side in what looked like love,  freckle on my lip finally.    I didn’t understand then, those kisses  weren’t meant for me, those kisses    would come.  Instead, she blessed my freckle with her mouth,    forehead to lip, lunar a lunar, kissing  where lovers would kiss me, my skin    receiving the dot where lovers  and husbands kissed her. Oh,    the weight of a hundred lips in that moment.    There are nights that we fill in our moons, mine  here in Brooklyn, hers in Boston, as she falls    asleep to Don Francisco.  I darken the spot, make it full, mimic her skin.    No se lo des a nadie, cielito lindo—  I sing advice to my face. I turn damselfish, tend an algae-garden  on the ocean floor:    glint and hue. No, I’m only knee-deep  with my eyes already stinging    and the goggles locked in the trunk  of our car. A gold ring    loose on my finger, my fiancé  already swum out so far with gray hair    bobbing like a buoy in the sharp water.  I daydream myself whale: glide and leap    through salt-air to feel breathless, falling  out of ways to say no , forgetting to water    the potted rosemary withering  on the windowsill of my kitchen-    turned-aquarium. Behind this glass  I’ll never swim deeper, never find    a place to hide, even with curtains drawn  or the beta shining in his tank, a sinking    tail’s flick. I’ll turn bride  at the edge of Pacific    where tides suck my ankle bones.  I’ll learn to gulp breaths, clutching    a damp pillowcase against the pearl-slick  of our sheets, that almost-softness    of a dull morning torn apart without compass  or tank of air or lessons on how to swim.  He’d have drowned, without me. -Carl Phillips    They kept saying leave nothing out, I can still hear them saying leave nothing out while I went on talking without a break about the incident in the parking lot behind 7-Eleven. Not really a parking lot, not the main one anyway, but a lot behind that lot, behind the store, where clerks unloaded palettes, broke down boxes, smoked cigarettes and weed and, yeah, I remember, parked their own busted-up cars. So it was a lot, sort of, and next door something #5. Not right next door, but a little down the hill, to the left, if you are in the main lot for customers, facing the 7-Eleven, to the left maybe thirty-five or forty yards, like a good breakaway run by a halfback, not half the length of a football field but close, China Palace, no, China Garden, China Garden #5. They had cats in that lot, by the dumpster, at least two litters, coon cats and dirty tabbies, mackerels and spotteds, to be exact, and some of the clerks said they, the Chinese, fed those cats so they could then feed them to the customers, call it duck or chicken, sweet and sour, stay or to go. Really, just one clerk said so: Jimmy. Jimmy, I’ll get to Jimmy. But behind that lot, and behind the lot of 7-Eleven, behind the other lots of our little town, of the laundromat and package store and the boarded-up Italian bakery, there was a drop-off, a little cliff, a kind of ledge, something you could stand at the edge of or even lie down on, your elbows right on the lip of the precipice and you could stare out. Or down, into the Mad River, flowing underneath the lights of the town and the sky at night like some thought you thought you’d buried years ago. That’s where I pushed him. Where I shoved him, I should say, after I hit him. Sucker-punched him, to be fair. With my right fist, though I’m left-handed. I never understood that part, even when they said leave nothing out, nothing, I said I struck him with my right fist, but the fact is I’m left-handed. The fact is he would have drowned, without me. I have to walk in order to think, I’ve always been this way, I told them, since that seemed important, me needing to walk in order to think, and not just about the incident but also about my girlfriend, school, my grades, very good that year, all A’s and one B, in art, an elective my senior year, something for fun and a nagging interest, something to not have to think about too much, or if you are walking and thinking about something else, there it is, the sudden and strange thought, I would like to try my hand at painting, or college is not for me, or I would like to kiss Abby who is not my girlfriend, and I hate the Beatles and all my parents’ music and I will tear the “Imagine” poster off my wall as soon as I get home. It seems like you should get an A in something that won’t hurt anyone. I told them this, and even though they said leave nothing out I knew they would soon have my report cards, my one speeding ticket, my karate trophies, my condoms, my journal I had stopped writing in for no apparent reason in the third grade. But I had kept the journal. I told them this but they said get back to the incident. We were inside a small room, not as I had imagined it, just an office, like my father’s, a few university degrees and photos framed on the wall, a coat rack, a desk lamp with a gold chain and green sheath. The sergeant sat next to me, instead of behind the desk, so that when I tried to say everything I could remember it felt like some invisible judge was in the chair behind the desk, and the sergeant, sitting beside me, talking directly yet softly, with full eye contact, his knees touching mine, once or twice, just brushing them in his pleated navy police pants, was deferring to this unseen presence, this absence, doing only his duty of questioning and transcribing, in a yellow legal pad that was almost out of paper, there were maybe three or four sheets left as he was writing quickly, leaving nothing out, the pad bent a little as he wrote, pressed the Bic pen into paper, and I wondered what would happen when he got to that last yellow sheet, to the bottom of it, a phrase he in fact said, when they had first brought me in, uncuffed, I wasn’t sure why, they wanted to get to the bottom of it and so I should leave nothing out, what would happen then, the last sheet flipped and the legal pad bare, just a flimsy piece of cardboard, the burgundy chair behind the desk tall and empty and oiled in the dim light? And so I walked in my mind, I mean, in my mind I walked, in order to think, but I did not walk behind the 7-Eleven, or anywhere along the embankment, the ridge, nowhere near the Mad River, but instead in my mind I walked around Nig’s Pond, a horrible name, I knew, I know, it wasn’t until junior high that I understood the name, the pond called Cumberland Pond until the early ‘70s when a black boy drowned there, in the pond, no suspects, an innocent drowning, so they said, they say even today, though no witnesses, no investigation, no coroner or D.A., the boy’s parents and sisters moving away, just days after the wake, though some say there was no funeral, not in this town, anyway. I walked around and around and around Nig’s Pond, which I still call by that name, if only in my head, to be honest, to not look away, to leave nothing out and in fact that is where I met the man I later struck. The preacher man, the people in the town called him, those who called him anything at all, though most called him nothing, as if he weren’t there, though he was, had been for years, decades, no one seemed to know his family, his age, not even his Christian name, the preacher man. He wore dark denim jeans and a jacket, a suit jacket, I mean, and he carried a briefcase in one hand and a Bible in the other, under the arm, the right one, I believe, the Bible, and maybe that’s why he said, I heard him say, though he was talking only to himself, as he walked around and around Nig’s Pond he said don’t let your right hand know what your left hand is doing, or was it, is it, the other way around, it’s from the Bible, I know, and the Bible the preacher man carried he carried under his right arm, tucked into his armpit, I do remember, and was he saying to not let the Bible know what the briefcase was doing, or had he gotten it backward, gotten it wrong, was it don’t let the briefcase know what the Bible was doing, what important documents did the preacher man carry in his briefcase, what old photos of family, what passages had he bookmarked in scripture, for when he sat down, the one time he sat down on one of two benches on the gravel path that circles Nig’s Pond, one bench facing the other, at the tips, the narrowest parts of the pond, for it’s an oval, not really a circle, he sat on one bench and I sat on the other, and to pretend I wasn’t watching him I looked at my watch, 11:58, p.m., it was almost midnight and I’d taken a walk to think, not a habit newly formed but unexamined, until now, as the preacher man began to rifle through his Bible, he sat on the bench directly opposite mine, facing me, except his face was in the Bible, he was looking for something, I could see he had dog-eared and bookmarked various passages of scripture, his favorites or maybe his least favorites, those passages that tormented him, that kept him awake at night so that he must reckon with them, but he couldn’t find what he was looking for, and he mumbled, he muttered, he stammered, I was too far away to hear the words, maybe fifty-five or sixty yards, but I could hear the struggle, across the pond, not an echo, for there was nothing to echo off except me, not substantial enough, too thin, not having eaten for days, no, the sound carried like bird calls across the pond, across the water, I don’t know the name, echolocation maybe, though that may not be the sound but rather the detection of the sound, by birds, or bats, circling in the air, in the dark, and the preacher man had stood, I hadn’t noticed, and he was circling, or ovaling, we could call it ovaling, to be exact, he had resumed his ovaling of Nig’s Pond, and instead of standing too I kept my seat, I don’t know why, and in four or five minutes he was passing me, as if I weren’t there at all, just an empty bench, he passed the bench, briefcase in one hand, Bible in the other, not in the armpit but now at the hip, his work boots, I noticed he was wearing Timberland boots, caked with dirt, saying to not let one hand know what the other is doing. Do not walk away early enough and it is suddenly too late and you can no longer walk away. Jimmy was smoking in the lot, the rear lot of the 7-Eleven, breaking down boxes, and as always, at least on these nights I’d found myself walking to think, at night, as always he starts up with the insults, insults made to sound like flattery. Tell me everything, he says, knowing there is nothing to tell. Tell me, did you eat that pussy last night, did you hit that pussy, did you hit it, he asks, knowing my eye has already strayed from Alexis and there is no sex to speak of, not for a couple weeks anyhow, but he passes me the joint and I take it, into my lungs, and I know the night is just beginning. Jimmy works graveyard, he worked the graveyard shift, high-school drop-out though he was close, so close to graduating, to an athlete scholarship at a D-2 school down south, he took the graveyard shift instead. His family a good family, not wealthy but not poor, blue collar, as my father might call it, though Jimmy’s collar was green, 7-Eleven green, the reddish- orange logo over the heart, or near it, he says he’s sick of bitches and why don’t we drive out to the beach this weekend, not the beach we normally go to, high school parties and bonfires, but the beach over the border, in Massachusetts, no more bitches, he says, or not these bitches anyway, get ourselves some pussy, he says, holding in the smoke, deep in the lungs, then breathing out a long plume into the cold night air, some new pussy. Dirty language, son, dirty language, the voice behind us. It’s the preacher man. Oh snap, it’s the preacher man, says Jimmy, taking another toke, the preacher man, says Jimmy, like he’s some old friend, a late-night pal, expected to show up at this hour, normal, a routine hang, out in the lot behind the lot, Jimmy looks over at the Chinese restaurant, sloping down maybe thirty-five to forty yards, its lights off except for a rear light, security light, lighting up a few empty crates and also, a little, the dumpster, but no cats are to be seen, must be inside, says Jimmy, inside the dumpster, or inside the restaurant, boiled and skinned and boned, wrapped in plastic in the walk-in, General Tso’s Cats, he says, laughing, get away from these bitches, he says, some new pussy, he says, and you, he says, looking me up and down, as if the preacher man were no longer there, or was always there, why you started dressing like a wigger, says Jimmy, I mean damn, tie your shoelaces, and look at your hair, you got zeked, he says, zeked. Ezekiel, says the preacher man, son of Buzzy, despised by the Jews, may God strengthen him, says the preacher man, no son of his own, no heir, his young wife dead, but then the cherubim, four pinwheeling swords of flame, says the preacher man, and today we have the bread, if nothing else, unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils and millet and spelt, Ezekiel, chapter four, verse nine. The air had changed, and so had Jimmy’s face. I looked closely at the preacher man, the ragged sharkskin jacket, the dark denim jeans, the muddy Timberlands, and before it was suddenly too late to walk away the preacher man walked away. Thus, the first incident. I record it to leave nothing out. Yet there was a second incident, which is the incident they insisted I recount in the office, the green light, the burgundy chair empty and waiting to make its judgment. But to leave nothing out, after the preacher man left, I followed him. Down past the dumpster behind the Chinese restaurant, a skunk skulking around the bushes, the preacher man calling it by name, Smiley, past Smiley the skunk and the lot behind the laundromat, then a ways, maybe seventy-five to eighty yards past the laundromat until we, the preacher man and I, stopped, near a heavy plastic tarp weighted with rocks on one end and the other flap tied to a shopping cart filled with milk jugs filled with water. I could hear the Mad River, flowing below even in winter, even in the freezing cold the Mad River flows. Only once, I remember, the surface glittered with ice. He talked to me then, about school, my grades, if I had a girlfriend, as if he were my father, or, rather, someone else’s father, a friend’s father, making normal small talk. Then he turned to me, took a seat on a log stump, and then situated another log stump, very smooth, very polished, almost like something bought at an art gallery, an antique shop, something my mother might put in the den, just to have it there, the preacher man positioned this other log in front of him, and before I could take a seat, just assuming, I am embarrassed to say, assuming it was for me, to sit and tell him about my grades, and karate, and how I’d rather kiss Abby than Alexis, the preacher man takes a fishing tackle box from under the tarp, opens it, and places a spoon on the smooth top of the stump, takes a hammer from the tarp and starts hammering on the spoon. He does this for a minute or so, a steady hammering, but just thudding, a bass line, nothing shrill, the hammer must have had a rubber head, it must have been a mallet, like at the doctor’s office, and each time he hammers the spoon, at least the first few times, it jumps, a little, like a knee, or, rather, the leg below the knee, a reflex, a little jolt, and then after a minute or so he looks up and says, Well, here you go. He hands me the spoon, and I have to walk closer to him, still seated on his log, and I take the spoon, now curled, curled in on itself. A ring. Try it out, he says, and I know that means to try it on each finger until I find the best finger, and I do, and it’s my pointer finger, or index finger, the more proper name. I delight in weakness, he says, in insults, he says, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties, for when I am weak, says the preacher man, then I am strong. This part, said the sergeant, his knee brushing my knee, leaning close, is this a direct transcript? Is this what the victim actually said? And I thought, before I spoke, victim, he called the preacher man a victim, and yet, if he, the sergeant, had listened, or had he ears to listen, as the preacher man might have said, he would have known the preacher man was strong, in his weakness he was strong and so he was no victim, despite what happened after he gave me the spoon, the ring. What happened is that Jimmy started laughing, Jimmy had followed us, had followed me following the preacher man, twenty yards behind me, if I were to guess, and here he is saying isn’t this the fucking best, how special, is that like some sort of friendship ring, some sort of engagement ring, you a couple fags now, what is this that I’m looking at? Dirty language, says the preacher man, dirty language, son. Jimmy approaches, gets close enough to blow smoke in my face, if he still had his joint, but he doesn’t, he doesn’t blow smoke in my face, his hands are empty, and so, now, is his face, the way it looked at the end of the first incident, and now in this moment I know this is the second incident, and that these incidents are one, this night is the incident. Spelt and barley and shit, spits Jimmy, toward the preacher man. I can dig that. But tell me, he says, tell me why they gotta force this hippie shit, this granola crap, on people, if I want a Wendy’s burger I’ll have a Wendy’s burger, if I choose to eat my breakfast at work, a hot dog and Slurpee the end of each shift, fifteen minutes with the door locked, a few minutes to myself, some quiet, the only fucking time in my life I get to think, then who says I need to eat lentils and barley and spelt? But, by this time, the preacher man has already stowed away his hammer and tackle box, his log stumps, sliding each under the tarp, and he has begun to walk away, his Bible in his right hand, his armpit, toward the brush and sparse winter trees on the embankment, the ledge, overlooking the Mad River. And we follow, though, this time, Jimmy follows the preacher man, and I follow Jimmy. Jimmy has continued the discussion about granola and flax and is yelling, arms stiff at his sides, on the ledge, the edge of the precipice, and the preacher man is no longer interested, no longer listening, it seems, staring out, over the Mad River, maybe toward the next town, the Still River, an illogical name for a river, impossible, really, he seems to be staring beyond this town, this world, and then Jimmy pokes him in the shoulder, from behind, not rough but also not friendly, almost the way you might poke a mannequin, uncanny in its likeness, so realistic, or a wax figure in a museum, when no one is looking, to see if it might move, even though you know it won’t, it can’t, the preacher man will not budge, but he does say, to the water below him, looking down, he says, Son. That’s all. Son. Jimmy turns the preacher man around, taking both shoulders, swiveling him around, and says, I ain’t no one’s son, you crazy bum, and that’s when I lunge. Without thinking I lunge to punch Jimmy, to clock him but I slip, in the mud, my shoes unlaced and tripping, tripping forward, and my fist, the left one, though I am right-handed, catches the preacher man in the temple, his left, to my right, and though I barely graze him, the ring on my left hand grazes his face, Jimmy steps forward and pushes him, the preacher man, and he stumbles backward, tumbles, into the night. As I did, out of my chair, the room no longer dimly lit but black, then my eyes open, my father standing over me, his open hand, his left, before him, my face burning as if held in ice water, submerged, dunked, my father saying leave nothing out, nothing, what about Jimmy, he’s the one, my father says, my father who had been standing in the doorway the whole time, now sitting in the burgundy chair, his back rigid, saying Jimmy is the one to blame, just say it, he struck the old man, he has nothing to live for anyway, he’s trash, just say it, but the sergeant now has my father by both shoulders, the sergeant is telling him to calm down, he is speaking both directly and calmly, almost whispering, saying calm down, saying we’ll take care of this. The office is dimly lit, the sergeant’s office, in his home, I realize, at that moment, he’d taken me to his home, after the incident, the second incident, after I’d pulled the preacher man from the Mad River, carried him up the hill, over my shoulder, I’m not sure how, after I get him up the hill, over the embankment, Jimmy nowhere to be seen, after I get him back under his tarp, with his logs and tackle box, the preacher man’s home, he now lying on his back, I hear him, as I lie on my stomach, right beside him, breathing now, steadily, just a bit of blood, beginning to cake, at the temple, and above the eye, the preacher man says, just once, Son, go, he says. And so I walk, the mile and a half to the police station, trying to think, walking in order to think but nothing, there is nothing there, I barely remember that walk, except that once I get to the station, just as I open my mouth, the sergeant takes a look at me and tells me to stop, he holds up a hand and says stop, then takes me away, uncuffed, in a car without sirens, without lights. You can lie down, on your stomach, stretched out with your face in your hands, and stare out. What would you see? If looking left to right, swiveling your head, slowly, like a coin-op camera for tourists, or these days a phone, in this panorama you’d see houses, ordinary white houses, and above, white steeples of the first Methodist church, then, swiveling slowly, the VA clinic, houses, more houses, trees, of course, spiny in winter, maples and oaks mostly, maybe a pine or spruce here and there, the sky, of course, often gray, usually gray, but now suddenly blue, if you keep looking, looking harder and deeper, the boarded-up KFC, off the interstate, bad location but now they say it might become a medical marijuana operation, or hospital, no one is sure, more houses, to the right past the highway, swiveling, the new high school, the new football stadium, then a family farm, been there generations, hogs and chickens, a field of alfalfa, then the dam, built in 1955, after the hurricanes, after the flood, they dammed up the Mad River, to keep us safe, though some say the river is now a cesspool, unsafe, to drink from, of course, but also to swim in, to wade in, though, if its name is dramatic, ominous, the Mad River, even dammed it is maybe five feet tall, or deep, I mean, where it runs through town it is five feet at most, shorter than most men, full-grown men, and even if it were shorter, or shallower, I mean, say four feet, or three, or four inches even, three inches, a baby can drown in that, they say, in an inch of water an infant could drown, face first, and that’s how I found him, the preacher man, in maybe six inches of water, the shallowest part of the river, though, therefore, the most dangerous, to be face- first in the rocks and trash, beer cans, twigs, broken glass, and so when I pulled him by the shoulders, the chest, trying to get him onto his back, when I finally got a good look at him, his face, he was cut everywhere, it seemed, his face bloody, blood in his nose, his eyes, his mouth, and so I took the sleeve of my hoodie, the whole forearm of it, all I had, and wiped his face, and wiped, until I saw he was only cut in one or two spots, above an eye, the left, his right, and at his temple, his face looked older, at least sixty, maybe sixty-five, someone able to get discounts at the movies, at restaurants, at grocery stores, if he ever dared enter such a place, ask for such charity. As he did today, after all these years, fourteen to be exact. I was finishing up some paperwork in the office, and was about to check on the new clerk to see if she’d changed her register, her shift was over, but she’d begun the habit of talking with the next cashier, a boy about her age, maybe a little older, I’d seen it before and there was no harm there, but of course I’m the manager, the night manager, and if we’re going to keep this business open all night we need to keep things moving, keep things on schedule, corporate says this is a trial run, we need to prove we can stay twenty-four-seven, in a town like this, the population just enough to qualify, for corporate to take a chance, we need to exceed all expectations, they like to say, and there I am, on the wall, framed, Manager of the Month, February, I try not to look but I do confess some pride, a little, and so when the old man came up to me, from behind, and poked me in the shoulder, I knew right away who it was. He had seen my photo on the wall, and recognized me, age thirty-one and already going bald, but he still crowned with a full head of hair, silver as his jacket, but, of course, it wasn’t him. The preacher man had passed, yes, he’d died, several years after the incident, and though there had been no wake, no funeral, no witnesses to the death, just a dead man under a tarp, which was left there a few days then taken down, the Chinese restaurant buying the lot, opening a new business, a Mexican restaurant, same owners, Mexican- Chinese menu, the preacher man was cremated and I offered, to the puzzlement of the crematorium, their nonchalant handing over of the box, not even an urn, I offered to take it. I threw it on a winter’s day into the river, the sky blue and the next town over, where I had done my time at the juvie, six months, on the fourth floor overlooking the Still River, then a year of community service, I’d insisted on that, though my father and the sergeant had kept their eyes on me in that dimly lit room I’d kept my left hand in the pocket of my hoodie, as the preacher man had advised, I had not let them know what my left hand had done. I had thought that was the right thing to do, for Jimmy, I mean, he was trash, as my father said, the whole town thought so, and that is the kind of incident that could have defined him, his entire life, but not for someone like me, or so I had thought, and so I did my time, I had insisted, and Jimmy went off to college, after all, I have heard, and here I am, walking in order not to think, late at night, early in the morning, aisle #9. The old man comes up from behind, and if he reaches out because he feels something, something radiating from me, or if he only wants to find some simple item for his home, a picture frame or garden hose, I do not know, I will never know, for the night clerk, the one who needs to change her register, the one I have sometimes imagined as a daughter, or even someday, a wife, I confess, has already come between us. She must have seen me, while chatting up the boy, at her register, #5, starting to get her bills and receipts in order, her silver and copper coins rolled, she must have looked up and seen me, suddenly standing alone, at 3:55 a.m., in aisle #9, a hammer in my hand, a rubber head, what’s called a mallet, and, even from that distance, saw that I was overcome. Polish a bronze moon-disc, see yourself reborn through Egyptian eyes.    Marvel at how the shape of your ears resembles handles of a porcelain cup.    Recall night swimming — the first time tight-laced limbs learned buoyancy in the dark.    End the day on a sleigh bed for adventure while dreaming, dip sheet corners in jet — trace arrows, fire, and flowers on your wrists instead of scars.    Share it with someone worthy, yet err on the side of orgasm.    Forgive its trespasses & those who have trespassed against it. Know temptation lives in your shoulder’s cup.    Adorn it with pattern, ink, & polish — stud it with jewels & millinery.    Grow a crown of silver.    Let your hands be raven-winged, the wood thrush play your throat like a harp.    Honor wildness — raise the ocean in your blood.    Remember the stars in your veins, your plumed ribcage.    Remember you are a rare bird. My   parents’   music   grows   softer   and   softer   and   softer   until   I   must   kneel   down,   place   my   ear   to   the   ground. Looking back, a Communist rally had fewer red flags –  my gaydar, utterly underdeveloped, did not register  a single echo on its screen. Three decades later, an  easy Google search, and everything all made sense.  Like when I told him I loved him and he said,  Thank you , as if I held open a door or passed him  a creamer of milk. Or how I misconstrued his patience  and manners for gallantry. So helpless in his grasp  of Latin, never delighting in the complex folds and arches;  his timid and tentative tongue treating my clit like  an impossible all day sucker when I wanted to be  devoured to my sweetest center. If I had offered him  another dark place in my body, what then?  I mourn our suffered years and the countless orgasms  left unspent by the best bodies of our lives.  I imagine his discovery and shock trailed by relief then dread –  having to come out to his large Polish-Italian family, saddled  with Old World machismo. Somehow, I should have known.  Maybe when straight porn didn’t fire him tumescent or when  we drove out of town for a romantic weekend only to return  hours later as bile replaced butterflies. I should have run  for the fucking hills. But I stayed.  Because he was kind and sweet. Because we didn’t know better.  Now when I see his life on social media, I take notice  of two things: his face has not aged a minute, and my absurd  pleasure in seeing his longtime partner’s black hair and brown eyes  dark as mine. Everything has a cost. This Arizona Iced Tea: ninety-nine cents. Dark clouds clump around stars like cellulite. The sidewalk stinks sickly sweet of rotting petals. An old lover’s tobacco breath won’t call me. I am a pillar of raw meat everybody’s squeamish to touch. That’s a lie. I could surely lure a hand if I went bar-flying in that dress I wore to the grocery store, the one that made the car of teenagers shout: show us your tits! It’s easier to be a body when I’m not watching. A boy I barely know says he got sober by masturbating constantly and binging horror films while I watch him smoke outside a church. It’s ugly how much I want him to pin me against the wall and run his hand up my skirt, remind me what it’s like to be greedy, a glass three fingers full. My white sneaker tips fall  across the long ragged road I throw my hair back  pretend indifference keep going far from  school I stop to feel the rough bark of a tree  make sure no one has followed breathe  two blocks from home they jump out from  behind a garage my bright green lunchbox one  two three four hope  a grownup appears to water the lawn pick  pink roses will send the kids away today no one  comes out the sky rises opaque blue no  rain rain is safer the boy with thick black  hair and the prettiest eyes I have ever seen  pushes me backwards he pushes hard I  land in mud cold damp seeping through  my socks they all laugh I don’t  move staring at the wild blossom of green  shoots in the sugar maple I count  leaves two three four five serene noble  this tree stands witness teetering to one side  like my grandmother from Russia whose gnarled  hands reach for my face eight nine ten eleven  the names they call me Stupid Ugly Selfish Dirty  Jew Pig tell them you’re a child of God I don’t  move until I’m certain they’re gone  when I rise up the blood from my knee  trickles down my ankle my shoulder aches  my legs shake I run home  to an empty stillness I draw a bath  then scrub at dirt that’s not there        I was walking with my cows on the meadow when I heard shots in the forest.  The clouds were high, the sky blue.  When they brought the Jews to the pits, a German played his harmonica.  A woman was forced to hold her baby in sight; first they shot the baby, then her.  When it was quiet, I went to have a look.  The pits were nearly filled.  I glanced only for a moment, and then I ran away.  I can’t say whether they were naked or clothed.  The bloody earth moved for three days.  Sometimes the soldiers paid us to bring them the gold teeth and clothing.  A boy from the village was also there.  We stared into the pits.  I remember my Jewish neighbors: Brick, Gorovich, Shurman, and Folst.    The bones of the Jews may not be disturbed; their faith forbids it.  Sometimes there are flowers growing in the fields. My mother sat in the shadowing light of a lamp, eyes closed,  cheek bones that are my bones in relief, the single sinuous line  of her nose— I have loved her more in dementia than I have ever known  how to love her before— her night has been my truth  these many years yet finally I am no longer afraid  to caress her forehead, as if she were my daughter now. Mark this truth: I am her, my mother  who has scattered fear like shattered bone in the tall  grasses of our hair, in the imagined grave we must fall into.   Edythe, Edythe, your daughter is here. My mother’s eyes flickered.   I love you she said. There was the dream  she said come to me  I will be leaving soon.  How can we harness love to find its measure?  Would one one-hundredth of a teaspoon tender the heart?  When will I know I have loved my mother enough to say I love you,  and the gesture, enough for her to believe. the sky is not yet dark  i open my eyes  and a hawk swallows  the moon    i never really wanted   to touch you–    now there are shells  covering my fingernails    what i wanted was to lick   the dust from your wings    i cough and a white moth  flies from my throat    its body floats  in the space left by moon  now there is river water  running through my veins    the hawk is choking  blood and spit in feathered collar    i never really wanted   to fuck you–    i close my eyes  and the sky fades to blue    what i wanted   was to be born inside you    a hawk is coughing  up the moon. soon    From Old English sōna (“immediately, at once”), also, Frisian, Saxon, Proto-Indo-European. Archaic: right now . Has come to indicate the near future. Has come to indicate promise, as: it will happen.    1. Within a short period, a) At a time that is not long from now, as: Soon , said the Magic 8 Ball. The church bells ringing meant that another of his friends would be buried soon . Soon , we will all sit down to dinner. Soon after the last time they gave him the money, he came clean. Who knew how soon we would grow old? b) In a quick way, quickly, as: How soon can you help us? After you watch the boy through one-way mirrors, how soon will you understand? After dinner, we play with the Ouija board, but my brother is high and nods off soon , before we spell anything. How soon can you give him more money? I wish you’d told me sooner . It was too soon to know. c) In a short time after something happens, as: The window has been broken, and soon the thief steps in. When the brother is desperate, he says he needs food, and so, as soon as they can, the family gives him money. When the needle is inserted, soon the body tingles like sleep and the brother nods off. How did it get so late so soon ?    2. Used to indicate one’s preference in a particular matter, as: The mother and father would sooner do anything than forget. They would all sooner wait for a knock on the door than answer the phone. I’d just as soon forget.    synonyms: any minute now, before long, in a little while, presently .  antonyms: after, afterward, later, never . The boy across the way takes everything I put out on the curb. So far, he has taken horse-head bookends, iron garden gates, a lazy Susan, old brown drinking glasses. Eventually, he will take the television.  What the old television broadcasts is a deep sky gray. Or, maybe, the sky is television screen gray. The night is flat-screen black, but the days in autumn in Vermont are older, and more convex. A girl would paint her fingernails  this color to look apathetic. Storm-cloud gray, with hint of foreboding. The fingernails would be the same as her eyes. She will not be one of the kids who dies on Route 2 in a car, doing something stupid, but she will smolder.  The television says she will likely maintain a wreath on a cross on Route 2 where one of her friends has died. The boy across the way will take almost anything I put out on the curb. I think about the girl, and putting her  out there, but she does not really exist, and the boy will not know what to do with her, her malaise, her grief, her eyes. He will lay her on a roll of mural paper and draw her outline, her hands too big and her feet like clown feet.  He will not know what to do next with the television girl, so he will do what he learned in school. He will make cut-outs of her organs, and paint them with paints that smell like leaf-rot, and paste them to her body. He will make  her heart like a heart, though, like a perfect bi-fold valentine. He will fail heart-making, like later in life he will fail map-making. He will fail to make her heart as it should be, shaped like an insect. He will fail to give it  an exoskeleton, but he will connect it properly to everything else. He will run string veins everywhere. He will end by running them back and forth across the street, to the river, to my house and his. He will cry and cry when she dies,  will shake her paper shape in his arms until it sounds like a man walking briskly through fallen leaves, a woman shaking out laundry to hang, a woman crushing newspaper for starting a fire, quickly, because the house is cold. Oh, my love,  he will say until he sounds like a man saying oh my love—tiny, pixilated, the horizontal hold gone, the small boxed world rolling up and up like eyes rolling back in sleep, losing signal, until he sounds like a man disappeared in snow. So what.  So what that you grew inside of someone else— it doesn’t mean you aren’t in here now, in here, right here.  Oh, my heart—what’s in here is not all my own anymore, anyway. There is Teflon, and stitching—other people’s hands have been in here.  By this I mean to tell you there is room.  There is a house in here I had hoped to fill.  I saved clothes forever waiting for more babies.  So, I wanted you. I always wanted you.  A heart has four rooms. You are one son.  There is room. When I was young and wanting to bring you home, they found the hole in my heart and patched it. I grow older and the outside door fails, and so I get a new one. In the lumber yard of the heart, the materials are strange, Teflon, like I said, for the hole and a valve from a cow to seal the doorway. Over and over, I shore this place up. Steady, old girl, I say to my heart, and I call in its ticks to the doctor. I love her, like I love you, like I have always loved you.  She calls me back and reads my stats. I call your sister and tell her the score, that I am always winning another day. Steady, steady, ticks the pacemaker.  I keep a good house.  You know that. These days, I keep my heart like a summer cottage. The light is bright and warm.  I won’t speak of anything else.  You forget, you forget all the time. You are supposed to come home.  You are supposed to know these things.  You are supposed to know which door to knock on, that I will open it.        If it were your daughter you handed the logs to, in a line like a conveyor, one thing would stand for another, stacking wood one way to know the past, where one thing becomes another, the shove of the shoulders and the pitch of the hips a thing more like grieving than dancing, of giving something away over and over, landing it with the precision of a triangle into an empty triangle, a curve into a swale, swing after swing, here and here, your palms ending up up, a sign like submission, like okay, like supplication. I am not sure where it ends, this job. No matter the cold, you are warm and no matter the cold, you hand her each log and she stacks it, you hand her each log and she stacks it, the sound another variable, pitched between bell and knock. She is so sure of where things go, here and everywhere. Somewhere in the day you start testing her, hand her the long table back at the farm, poultry feathers everywhere, the pile of gravel that sat for years, the rusted baler, hayfields gone by, smashed plates, you hiding, you playing this game until memory runs out and all there is is what was. You see what she does, see: no matter the cold, she is warm. She moves back and forth, makes nothing of the dying boxelders, their leaves no memorable shape. There is no taking stock. She works with you like you are working, until you are finished, your backs bent the same…emotion is perhaps nothing but an expression of a poetry that was lost.  -Gaston Bachelard    A cry contracts around teeth and tongue. We call it word. We call it please, yes, don’t. Water stolen from the well.  Are you sad water, lapping against your own edges?  Are you angry water? Do sailors splinter in your ragged wake?  Take a moment and throw yourself overboard. Take a moment and compose the wreckage.  *  Movere , to move, prefixed by e-, designating externality. So she emotes, turns inside out.  Weeping works this way. Laughter works this way too.  *   But you, you can dream forever and still not remember who I was. (F. Stanford)  Multiply the beloved x number of times. Divide the beloved by yourself. The beloved is constant. There is only remainder if the lover (that is you) is irrational. (Ha.)  An incomplete idea makes you heartsick the incomplete idea of the other you hold in your mind like a skirt without fabric you pull and pull as if desire were a sublime act of imagination, as if the other were a seed planted inside you and you were merely cultivating garden. An incomplete idea like a planetary body eclipsed and you are the body and you are the eclipse. 1.	Before you were this animal, when your skin muscled to surface and you picked feathers from your teeth with the bones of the bird you swallowed, the earth of another sky rained glass upon you. A moment shy of glass rain, you could inhale the ground on which you stood. You yourself could be inhaled, the incinerated mass of you. A bright pink lung becoming breath for a body that doesn’t survive it. A bright pink lung falling to earth to become what time allows or requires.  2.	In the conversion of ice to vapor, three distinct heats. At some point, convert joules to calories, for the sake of conversation. At some point, think heat as kinetic energy. Do this especially if it is midsummer, 103°F (convert to Celsius) and you lay naked on damp, sweaty sheets in a third-floor apartment. To test the hypothesis of converted energy, put a piece of ice in your mouth, hold it x number of minutes on your tongue, and exhale.  3.	Before water, the feeling of water. Before wind, the feeling of air about to be blown. Before now, then. Before then, now.  4.	What once you were. Once you pinked. Once you tantrumed. What you felled, how you fell, smoked, kissed with just your lips. Once you breached, birthed, held like bird bones in your nest. What once you absorbed, sank into, perched atop. Once you stopped holding up mirrors, stopped giving a shit. Once you reviewed, rehashed, reminded. Once settled. Once folded and paled. What once you stilled.  5.	Exhibit A: unpumped blood sinks, consequence of gravity. Exhibit: eyes without light. The sudden meat of a hand. Some fragment of thought hangs in the air, indefinitely suspended. In another temporal geography, a child will lick it off the ceiling and taste its acceptance, turn to the bitter man in the corner drinking fermented corn or rice and say, though we walk through the valley, no fear, no fear. The child will think death tastes like honey. Goldfish says, I’m the color of light because my father is the sun. Goldfish says, if you look straight into me your eyes will burn. Goldfish wiggles next to my nipples and reads the braille of my goosebump diary. My boyhood aches in the cold, an eye open underwater. I pray my swim trunks have not wobbled away with the jellyfish. Goldfish says my soul reads like ripples on the surface. He rubs his scales off on my torso as pennies for the luck. Goldfish revolves around my head to imitate his father. I know the sun does not revolve, but I do not tell him. Bubbles float from my nose like dozens of blinking eyes. Goldfish nods like he understands what froths behind my uvula. If Goldfish could tell time, he could be mistaken for a pocket watch. His tail ticks back and forth like a clock. Goldfish says focus on his golden comet tail. Bruises float like fish on the ocean of my chest. He opens the cave of my mouth to kiss its small pink fish. I cough him out, spitting fishwater. This is normal, he tells me. I am learning how to swim. O, hip bone (yours) over thigh bone (mine) buttressing (cathedral-body night) what we cannot bar.                                                We will not gate it  (any longer): this pink bird of thundering (sometimes gorgeous), the beast undoing what we’ve made: (a marriage                                                      in gossamer).  I never told you my great-grandmother stopped attending church. Our daughter sings doxology at                                                           her window (open) so  the neighbors hear her glory. Two black-hooded nuns forced her (my grandmother) to hit her brother                 over and over                         in front of the class  red marks burning (now) into all our arms. Sicut erat in principio,  when the word became                                                     flesh, the ghosted holy  over, et nunc, my plague-masked face (the woman you see), et semper, if we can unbless (our union)                                                        make it newly feathered,  et in saecula saeculorum , (which world) any place we feel alive again, our skin unharmed by wind                                                         by flame, by living (hand).         The man who held me down slit my ulna—my tongue didn’t tell—& sucked out the marrow. He devoured me in stones, in howling. But this kind of thing happens all the time, doesn’t it, being taken (cauterized), even if your body is still here? A girl taken from a park five miles from our house—her collapsed skull & broken femurs in a dumpster. Her poltergeist dangling from the chandelier. The man who held me down is also somewhere tonight, perhaps tucking his own girl into bed, latching the windows, pulling shades. Showing his son a moon so bright it can hide nothing. My tongue still laced in his belt. Its last words, O light, O rope . Another kind of snatching— my grandmother’s poodle stolen in 1922. Wet fur still stuck on pilled stockings she knotted & threw into the fireplace. She prayed, keeping her hands behind her back: tied. Untying God. Because when a child ( or dog ) goes missing, you’re left with his afterimage. Buried in sand. Her prayers were for remembering— the dog’s shadow on the wall, his bark lost in rose bushes, his water dish dry. Don’t let me wake thinking he’s gone ( thinking he’s here ). Let hope be a woman unzipping her dress, an un- flowering god—the body has corridors—the empty womb relaxes— relaxes—contracts. I’m the mother brought to her knees (these children siphoned my breath), trying to right my balance, clavicle heaving, a clothesline in wind. I touch the gritty ring (the body can be taken. The body can be found) they left in the tub. They play (faces red in leaves) happily beyond my shadow, not knowing who watches from the woods. I’ll never know their last moment with me, as if the parting of our bodies in the delivery room wasn’t already our most binding pain. I listen as my daughter prays the Hail Mary, blessed are you —in the hollow where I don’t speak, I ask to take their place. Someone must be given. The Story About the Dog   that walked everywhere with a boy who became my father, you’ve heard it— you’ve heard it all before, the black dog with the rough patch, brown over his left haunch, waited on the riverbank as my dad waded in to fish—my dad still says water is his saving grace, the thing keeping him here. He lives on a lake & the smell of water in the air stirred when his stepfather creaked the door with his belt. & there’s no sweet song of a choir, not even on the radio as the belt comes down on my dad’s back & the dog growls, takes it on the hip bone, on his dry nose, against the bristle of long bared tooth. For hours, that dog did nothing but watch & wait. I inherited my dad’s jawline—you know this too. I like to think I inherited his dog’s jawbone, when my father cradled that dog in his arms after a truck crushed his body, you remember what that dog did—licked his face, his tears, licked where he’d been hit—before it died. I want to make something beautiful before I die. To be that dog—did it even exist? Or was that one more story my dad told to make his childhood less terrifying? A dog belted, a dog living in my dreams, growing so large he is also my father. On June 24, 1973, The UpStairs Lounge, a gay bar in New Orleans, was firebombed, resulting in the death of 32 people who were locked inside. The city dismissed the need for a thorough investigation and disposed of some of the bodies in a mass grave without allowing the bodies to be identified. Nobody was ever convicted.      You compressed your chest and torso to fit between the bars of the window,  a space no wider than the length of an average man’s foot. On fire,  you fell like another piece of debris blown out the window. Let me catch you.  Here, jump onto this trampoline that never came, charge down these lines  like fire escapes, leap into the space where you’ll never have to fall.  But who am I for you to trust? They say it was another gay man  who started this fire, who doused the stoop in lighter fluid before dropping  the match. And all that I have done is write poems, more rooms  for you to enter and never leave. Let me try something else:  You’re in the UpStairs Lounge drinking an Old Fashioned with Reverend  Larson, talking about Acts and his sermon on Pentecost. Mitch and Louis dance  by the jukebox blasting Cher and fire hangs above your heads, calls your names. 1.  I want to be the lemons in the bowl  on the cover of the magazine. I want  to be round, to be yellow, to be pulled    from branches. I want to be wax, to be  white with pith, to be bright, to be zested  in the corners of a table. I want you    to say my name like the word: Lemon.  Say it like the word: Limón. Undress me  in strands of rind. I want my saliva to be    citrus. I want to corrode my husband’s  wedding ring. I want to be a lemon  with my equator marked in black ink—    small dashes to show my shape: pitted & convex.    2.    I lie on my back in the grass & let the weight  of a man on top of me. Out of breath, he searches  for a place on my body that hasn’t flooded.  The only dry patch left is my hair, which he uses  to wipe the sweat from his face. He is disgusted  because I have turned the earth beneath us  damp. He says I am an experience, like standing  in an irrigated grove of lemon trees. He says  I am the water pooled at each trunk, infused  with citrus & pesticide. He says my moisture  brings mold & my body is nauseating.  I wonder if I had not said his name over & over  if he would still think of me as small & round  & fresh as lemon—as vaginal & arched as limón.    3.  I wear a peineta & pin a mantilla to my hair  I want to be Conchita Piquer warning women  of becoming lemons. The goal: tener alguien    quien me quiera. I want to be my mother singing me  to sleep: a la lima y al limón, te vas quedar soltera.  My grandmother hated peinetas, mantillas, and women    who wore too much gold. She’d say this pulling my hair  tight into a bun. She hated peinetas & mantillas:  pero la necesidad obliga. I don’t want to be the woman    whose skin dissolves into the caldos she makes  for her dying parents. That kind of woman cries alone  because she has no fat husband to make her cry    in a home all her own. A la lima y al limón, tú no tienes  quien te quiera. a la lima y al limón, te vas quedar soltera.    4.  My body is a frutería where wives send  their husbands to ask for a dozen limones.  I pull at the fat around my waist & unravel    a plastic bag. I count each limón from the bin  between my ribs & feel for the juice under  thin skin. Each husband takes a piece of my body    home with them in every limón. A piece of my body  they can slice into quarters & squeeze into  their beer. A piece of my body to press into sugar    & feed to their children laughing at the TV.  What more can I give than my body in pieces  to strange husbands? What more can I give    than the limones that grow between my breasts?  Tell each husband: Show me your list, I’ll pull  these items from my body to take back home to your wife.    5.  When the stranger learns I speak Spanish  he makes me stand in my underwear & read  from Borges’ El Aleph . & because I only want  the stranger to love me, I read, & wonder if Borges  could help me jump through a period on the page  to my death. After, the stranger whispers:  You are lima, your tongue strips ink from pages. I wonder  if the stranger imagines lima as green or yellow,  as sweet or bitter—or as a city where the snow  collects on your lover’s eyelashes in mid-July.    Say limón: clean & ripe & bursting on your tongue.  Say lemon: broken & ugly & not up to par.  Say lima: Rimak & rima & spoken from God.    God speaks. Rima. Rimak. God has spoken.  Rimak. Rima. Lemon. Lima. Limón.  If all our eyes had the clarity of apples …    –from Bernadette Mayer’s, “The Garden”    If all our eyes had the clarity of apples, if all our thoughts  were as sharp as a pineapple’s bracts. If all our bitterness    could be finely minced, thrown into a pot with the softening  yams, the small white beans. Add a little thyme, both dried and doused    with rain, add a tablespoon of basil; let the flavors marry and meld,  let the steam fog the kitchen windows, loosen November’s chill.    If all our children reseeded like volunteer tomatoes. If grief loosened  with a tug like the late fall carrots from the weedy patch out back. If you don’t mind, I’d like to share about a not-  yet-blooming amaryllis, stalks taut in brown dirt,    flame tucked tightly beneath an emerald skirt.  I know a little about seahorses, eggs which the female,    spiraling out from sea grass, loosening her grip on his tail,  deposits into distended emptiness. Slimming, swelling,    the world might be clover or clever—depends on whether  I’m on my way to the store for balloons or ballasts,    whether, last night, outside my window, there was hooting  or shooting. There’s nothing wrong with knowing only a little    about wheeling in unison, that pre-dawn dance in which skin  may morph from mauve to brown. I’ve a mania for saints like Francis,    blesser of narwhals and wolves. While I acclimate to the dawn,  a seahorse grabs hold of a piece of coral, begins its gestational wait.  A child of, say, six knows you’re not the shape she’s learned to make by drawing half along a fold, cutting, then opening. Where do you open? Where do you carry your dead? There’s no locket for that—hinged, hanging on a chain that greens your throat. And the dead inside you, don’t you hear them breathing? You must have a hole they can press their gray lips to. If you open— when you open—will we find them folded inside? In what shape? I mean what cut shape is made whole by opening? I mean besides the heart. We’ve been at this for years. So long, it’s a kind of marriage. Why not believe the shadow  feels affection for the flesh? That it longs to be bodied, that it dreams of all it could do for me?  Sometimes I imagine handing it a bag of groceries from the trunk and sending it into the house.  We’ve been at this so long, it’s grown on me. It grows, blurry doppelganger  so nondescript, it’s hard to know even close-up—all outline, nothing inside. What is a shadow  if not vestigial? A partner only in a certain light? I’ve thought about calling it Lula, the name  I’d been saving for another child but will never need. We’ve been at this long enough—  so long, it feels like marriage. We touch without touch, take turns outgrowing one another. After dry cleaner, after supermarket, after housework; after Windex, after Pledge, after Joy; after Woolite, after All, after Bounce; after he comes home at five, after dinner at six, after TV at eight; after the evening news, after the eight o’clock sitcoms, after Jon Stewart; after how was your day, after can you pick up my shirts, after see you in the morning– the garbage always goes out on Monday nights. Then—up too late, can’t sleep, alone on the couch—I conjure you from an old black & white movie on the TV.  Eighteen-year-old you, an usher at the Hamlet Street Theater, and me at sixteen that summer I’d come to loiter in the lobby during the pictures just to sit too close to you on the open window ledges, and you snuck us back stage behind the lit up screen, to lay me back on a stage prop bench, and then bend over me— our white shirts flaring with all that light.  Over your shoulder, through the scrim, faces in the audience stared at the projected movie heads not seeing your handsome face so close to mine and that your eyelashes glistened with silver or feel the warm through your clothes, your breath mingling with back-stage smells of fresh-cut plywood and wet paint, and then the big screen voices fading as I, when your mouth pressed against mine, learned how to feel a smile.  Perfectly formed ice cubes clatter into the white plastic bin of the Stainless Steel General Electric side-by-side refrigerator, and the house settles for what’s left of the snoring night that gives in to the dark windows’ and closed doors’ right angles that square the room.  And all the furniture remains exactly where it has always been.          Strip malls like this are common hunting grounds rich with food rotting easy to scavenge–   in myths crows arrive with bright Valkyries to gather the best fighters from battle   and usher to Valhalla; they look close to discern warrior or rancid meat–   again perched on top of my car, a crow waits on me as I exit the market,   its murder loud somewhere I cannot see, their sound fills the air like laughing ghost birds   that egg on this cocksure raven glaring– in his feathers’ sheen the eye’s a wet stone   staring–so that I’m sure this third time’s no random act: on the third day a third crow. Whatever was underneath my fingernails  when I was tired and trembling    My grandfather’s lemon drops  found wedged under the edge  of the ancient pea-green rug  that covered the perfect oak floors    My cuticles    Olives abandoned in anyone’s glasses  when the lights went on at 1:53  and I was always nowhere again    Icicles I knocked down with a broom  then dug from the grey snow beneath    The last page of the last paper letter  describing what they wanted me to send    The skin of my cracking mouth. They hid the world from us patients confiscated radios and magazines there were no TVs so we could focus fully on why we were in here in a psychiatric hospital in bucolic Vermont.  But everyone needs a break from days filled with therapy from talking of drinking and depression drugs and suicide some of us fell in love others ate too much and purged it many smoked one woman cut her arm.  I found my escape from institutional living in a hidden peephole to the universe I snuck in the staff lounge when I knew they were eating squatted before a newspaper dispenser and read the top half of the front page of The New York Times .  Millions of people were protesting that spring in China students, workers, and old people even military men when I got bored listening to other people’s problems in group therapy, my mind wandered to what was happening today in Beijing.  Sometimes the story was in the middle of the front page so I could just read the first paragraph when I couldn’t see it I figured that no news was good news nothing had changed much so the story was at the bottom or inside.  One early June staff lunchtime I could read what was happening before I reached the dispenser door huge headlines screeched alarming news tanks had rolled into Tiananmen Square.  On their way in, they killed hundreds of people gunfire flooded crowded city streets people in their apartments died while studying and making dinner those on the street were shot in the back.  The next day, the dispenser framed a stunning image four tanks stopped before a single man just one man where days before there were thousands he simply stood still and screamed Stop!  That photograph helped me embrace treatment and get on with the rest of my life near the twentieth anniversary of the carnage I watched a PBS documentary on the fearless worker now known as Tank Man.  China tries to hide the world from her people like the hospital tried to hide it from me students interviewed at the University of Beijing said they’d never seen the famous picture of Tank Man before and murmured surprise when they learned he’s an international hero.  But the world always finds a way to trespass one young man whispered to the others  Must be the events of 1989. When I wake I’m vacant, meaning  still in the abyss, still human,  pulled out of bed by the listing  of things begging for doneness.  I decide to skip another meal, meaning    I feed myself on whisky and dark  corners before sunrise.  The neighbor’s dog is moaning  his wail again, drawing the sun up  out of the dirt, slow and painful, meaning    the day is coming for us, again.  I sink further into the quiet space  I’ve carved out in the corner, hidden  by the cloak of shadow so when you rise  you’ll pass by me, meaning    you don’t really see me at all.  I have no sons or daughters, no mouths  to feed, which is to say we can leave  at any time. Waking up to someone  each day, it’s a beautiful and captive thing, meaning    you want to poke holes in the floorboard,  open all the windows, pull each door  from its hinge. Dirty laundry told me a story about the famous question.  After you sweat, God forbid, my black and white stain is returned to me, a casket fond of clean chances.  This level of care can wonder – a little dream, a cheap guide.  Come out, disappear, stretch: ask the time inside-out, the color soft.  Shrinking, your body says,  scared , among silks, outrageous somewhere with clouds of smoke.  So breathe. Wonder. As if an at-home presto! is free of limitation.  I have dust settled on mishaps, the twist in theory only. Today you are six months old,  though we never got to count  that far together. Since last summer  I have been trying to be pinker,  tiny palms and noses sewn into the hem of small breasts.  I have been trying to live for half a family, to scatter you  in places you would have never gone. The sun shines  everywhere, I forgot to tell you this—  I couldn’t even convince you that this world  is safer with you in it.    Did you leave because I asked or  was there some flaw?  Was I the flaw?  Did you pick a better mother?  I picked an easier life.    Did you burn your handprint into the asphalt  so that I would never forget you were here?  You were born a teenager. Sometimes  I see you dancing along the curtains,  flickering, far-flung,  the leaves in the embroidery.    You are better than I am.    Look at me.  Here is the topography  of my uterus, the leylines drawn  from your unformed fingers.  Here is my leapfrog heart,  still trying to play,  dragging heavy  with your nameless weight. I.  In ancient Greek, my name has origins in the word for bees – honeybees, and the honey itself. These days I have come to understand what that means: that I am heavy on the tongue, best washed with water, sweet for many, good with bread and butter.  II.  My dad tells me I was named after a singer, and my mother wanted to name me Georgia, which comes from Georgiana, which comes from George, which means farmer. I know nothing about crops, only seasons and how to close my eyes at night, five years old, and hope I grow – and how to close my eyes at night, twenty-four years old, and hope I grow –  III.  In the Filipino tradition we take our mother’s maiden name and scoot it behind our middle name as a reminder that we came from a woman who came from a man. Maybe this is why I didn’t get Gonzalo after Anne – or maybe it was just a mouthful. But I’ve been told my full name is Melissa Anne, no hyphen, which means there is a blank space.  I want to fill it with grace the way Mary filled Batangas with showers of roses and said, do not be afraid.  IV.  The only time I wanted to be called something else was the first time you called me love.  V.  The more names I have the more I feel like I have a story— Gonzalo and Tolentino and Therese, from my confirmation clinking glasses with God, not church and Villanueva.  It means new settler: the day I was born new, an icicle that melted slowly with the heat of the world and the words of men.  VI.  The soft s in Melissa comes from the soft s in disorder from the quiet laughter of snakes after all of the apples are gone. You are responsible for recovering every wounded animal. If the wounded animal breathes as though it were underwater, in terrible gulps or sharp pants, make a humming noise. If the wounded animal makes a chirping or clicking sound, a stammer, a thump, if its body heaves up and down like a water pump moves inside its stomach, if its whiskers and mouth twitch, a tick like a switch, if its big paws paddle the air, if it bares its teeth, let it sleep. Your presence may comfort. Even if the wounded animal runs from you, even if it is shot in the critical heart-lung, even if you mark in your mind the spot it has fallen, in cover, watch over. Crows and ravens may lead you back to the wounded animal. Stay at a safe distance. A wounded animal will attack its own cubs. If the wounded animal’s eyes are bloodshot, if they weep rusty water or are frozen in a stare, if they wildly blink or stutter or seem to stumble inside their sockets, build a fire. If the wounded animal is bleeding from its eyes look up at the sky. If the wounded animal’s body suddenly seizures, is stripped of suppleness, if its chest is strapped by some unseen and terrible belt, place a swatch of soft fabric over its rigid and rippling body. If the wounded animal has hidden under pine needles, broken bark or fallen logs stand still without making a sound. If there is no slight breath, no small sigh or struggle, no wheezing or wobbly exhale, no hollowed out moan, no low groan or lonely murmur, if there is nothing left of the wounded animal, place your hand on its head. There is no god to hear your prayer. Kneel and press your forehead into the earth. Do you hear the wind push through the dry grass? At least there is that. At least there is the sky with its burning colors. If you fail your wounded animal, if you went looking for water or food or shelter, if you let the wind distract you, if night fell before you could dress its wounds or bathe its broken leg, if you forgot the exact diameter surrounding the wounded animal, the contours of ash field and ice-covered stream, or crumbling mountain and wide pasture, you are still responsible. You are still responsible for the wounded animal even at night, even in the darkness of your tent, even in your sleep, even in your sleep. I’ve made it my job to think about death.  Outside, in the chill darkness.    Stars show up in fits and starts as if  we’re to decode them. Maybe death  comes on like that: lit, pulsing.    Or like wind in the hedgerow  touching every needle, setting the cypress  in motion, but really nothing.    Since you arrived, gave me the news,  I’ve been here on the headland,  watching black waves. Slip away, surge.    Maybe it’s a return. Maybe fluid.  Summertime, at night, by the sea,  it doesn’t seem that frightening.    You’re inside, back at the house,  taking an infusion of friends’ voices.  I’ve made it my job to think ab out death.  Yours, to practice staying alive. Suppose I could tumble into the Charleston harbor  and waves could weave my hair into roses,  float me in dark until I forgot the jagged  fault lines underneath. Suppose a sandspur’s  hooked in my foot and the skin on my heel  is Charleston and my eyes hurt from reading  the newspaper from that paper mill furling over the bridge.  Suppose my mother took my hand and dragged  me all over Charleston, where people don’t play music  on the streets, the music is bottled  and comes out of vending machines like Coke.  Maybe my hair is salted full of sandgnats.  Maybe I bled on a cannon aimed at the sea.  Suppose the black children in Market Street paintings  were nailed to their joggling boards. Suppose the bridesmaids  in plantation weddings wore dresses of red clay  and devoured cake with stained teeth. My mother smiles  when she directs strangers to the slave market,  when she explains those bright colored houses,  how they’d send slaves to the pink, the purple, the green.  I hate to talk about these things.  If the cobblestones cracked, teeth would bubble  over the streets, and they’d be pink, purple,  green, and sharper than steeples.  Suppose my mother had palms like pine bark  that stung when she clapped,  that her skin melted and broke like praline.  Suppose we were braided together into a sweetgrass basket  and saw the sun in slits and someone lit a match.  I need to talk about these things.  I need to smell horse shit behind carriages  in the street and I need to tell people about Charleston  because my bones are wrought iron  fences, they hold me up like iron earthquake  rods between Charleston houses.  When the ground shivers like skin  brushing off a fly. i am talking to myself as she prostrates herself on a stage     and says to the masses (which are really only me)          here i am come & kill me  i pelt her with little alphabetic prayers        a list of words  one for every day of bleeding                 ( arcana spill or split bordeaux guilty gentian hollow lilt )  we each pretend this means anything it doesn’t       they’re just words i picked  because i liked them       she knows this she expected more she wanted me  to come at her with a dagger         says cut it out of me i don’t want it  you don’t get a choice i tell her you were born with this blue belief        this heart in your hands  eat it if you want it gone. As a child, I’d hide under the kitchen table and announce: I’m going away now.  My father always said, don’t forget to write, but my mother pretended to cry until I begged  her to stop, my own eyes wet with tears. I want to drive a car as far as it will go,  hear the final, fatal pop as a rod impales the engine block, leave the door wide open, my purse and money  on the seat. I want to hide in the bushes until help comes, watch strangers peer  at my license, thumb pictures of my family. I hear them read the back of a photo: Jamie, age 8, in smudged ballpoint.  They twirl my lipstick, finger my pill bottles, touch scraps of paper, then fan out, looking for me,  absorbed, diligent, the way a baker makes bread, with a certain purpose, a drive to finish the task. I wonder  when I should step from the shadows, twigs in my hair, a long scratch down one cheek. I wonder  when the joyous reunion will start. With crayons and the clean sides of our dads’ used paper from work  we lay on our stomachs drawing horses. None of us  had seen a real horse. We didn’t know  about saddles and bridles, bits and breaking. We’d never  smelled horseshit, nor stood next to an animal that weighed  a thousand pounds. It didn’t matter. Mares  and stallions reared and galloped through our imaginations.  We gave them wings, pink eyelashes, and the power of speech.  We shivered as their huge mouths searched our hair  for hidden carrots, lipped sliced apples from our palms.  We wound their manes around our fists, buried our faces  in their warm, dusty necks, and dreamed, not of escape,  but of the not-yet-understood animal power of our  not-yet-understood lives, poised and ready to take off. As if it were an article of clothing discarded during an act of passion,  a crow feather stops me on my way to the car, arms full of packages,  and my day tilts as I enter a portal to another time and place where  once I flung a pair of black lace panties across the bedroom.  The whole year was like that: charged, raucous, exhilarating,  bed the lushest of forests, rain-made waterfalls appearing  overnight, a sloppy nest right under the window trickling twigs.  At home I find the panties under cotton socks and an old T-shirt.  Rows of ruffles in front, see-through net in back. The force that catapulted them  shivers through me. I crush them in my fist, then tuck them back  into the farthest, darkest corner of the underwear drawer.   i. I was unwell so my doctors gave me poison many cultures have this tradition  many cultures revere their sick revile or revere the illness revere  the sickened as holy for carrying a disruption of such burden  as a doctor can only add to for containing a demon or humor or wind or abstraction or whatever  beats against the inner boughs of life with such power  as to undo a man back to only the frame of his being clay breathing     in order  to spare the healthy confusion give me your poison weaken me  that this illness which as winter’s wind fills winter’s clean  branches fills me may be weakened weaker than voice   ii. what is a voice what is a voice  O god of indeterminate origin wearing me like a skin  rooted into me past poison or prayer what is a voice.   Deserts too are the source of it:  as a child who would be contented crying    or a lace purse that becomes more full  of holes delights in losing balms.    Forget, forget: the cream dilutes  its fats into black tea, unfurls.    What would I admit to?  I enjoyed observing: things    disappear. We are not permitted  articulate visions of their last moments    in our hands. The swathes of burned flesh  regain their healthy pink    while the owner sleeps.    I can’t explain here. Discomfort  wails until she’s tired; arnica stings. Bank of golden rod, bank of tall  grass: the doe and fawn    by the roadside quake, or  don’t, while the cars pass fast    and eyeless. Lidless headlights,  hatless drivers. The dog    in the median might be a stray  but he looks like a wolf    from here: white ruff of long hair,  blue eyes like signals    blink before each driver.  If you stop to gather    yourself, will you  feel the chaff fill your lungs    or does it happen    so quickly? I fail to react  to so many attendant things.           When I was small I thought horses  Were bald creatures,    Smooth as my plastic ones. How strange  When I saw one up close, stroked    Its shoulder, found it furry like a tall rabbit.  My body also was strange to myself,    All downy arms and legs, gentle  Fuzz of face, innards soft    Under skin, subtle and insidious.  I could not bear to get close enough    To see if I was the only one  Afflicted so. At a distance    My defects remained invisible  So I practiced being always    In the background of the picture,  Distant enough to be hazy, small    And malproportioned by perspective,  Approaching the vanishing point.  One house sits  quietly on this,  the street of carousels.    Who will set  the horses running?    Stubborn as dahlias,  their poles grow dim    with sun. Doesn’t mean  they’ve never run.    When I walk by  I furtively caress  their flanks.    They lie. They lie.  They know  they are alive.    I’ve seen them gaze  on our house    in the middle  of the night.    I’ve heard  them neigh.    They say, they say:  anything they touch    remembers it was touched. i.        Fruit-Flavored Lip Glosses  I took care of a little girl who had a feeding tube and a trach tube. Every four hours, I’d open the gasket surgically implanted in her stomach, and pour in a can of nutrition. She’d plug her trach with her finger and sing, breathily-whispery.  Her mother bought her flavored lip glosses, and she’d slather her mouth. Tongue in & out, little snake, the comfort of taste.  Sometimes she’d sneak a popsicle, and we’d find evidence in the sticky phlegm of her trach, the peculiar grey-purple of artificial grape.  ii.         The Leaning-Tower-of-Pisa Souvenir Lipstick Case  inheritance of jewelry boxes of hat pins  if I wait if I want if I claim it it remains what remains. Under its case  would be the color of a mouth parted  the things you would say unsaid  Here is the quiet that stalks the trinket  what is missing is the weight of carnauba wax and carnadine, alizarin and lanolin what is missing is the generation that comes next  passed from mother to daughter to daughter to  iii.        When My Grandmother  stopped eating, my mother bought her flavored lip glosses.  First, know I wished for too much—    tapioca in a cracked bowl                          the shotgun seat  of an Oldsmobile                           a blues song                        Stevie Wonder    A train  moaning in the dark                       July afternoon.    We speak of boxcars                      of leaving                         of the topography  of this state—    The sky darkens                             you sigh                              I wonder what gods  are these that threaten us with oncoming rain    I wonder                            where the rabbits on the roadside go  when the rain comes    I taste your tapioca & it has hardened  tiny matte pearls. The rain comes                           turns    to hail                                 we sit in your car with empty space  between us                          endings all around us.

Like if you could zip it and belt it: This isn’t a coup, a flock of crows.  You find her naked on the bent reed, One note, one note.  If you could dress her in harmonics It would be apology.  Like you mean it this time. Like you haven’t been saving up ballads, folk wolf.  Like her sad. Arpeggios Swallowed and spliced thrumming  Akin to a fight and flight, Smoke signal hanging tooth and nail.  Like if she hit your lips hard. Like if she could hide you, wishing,  Wadded in one cheek. Like an Ozark moon goes corn meal on the tongue  And bars cripple again in the glottis. If you could hold her fast then slow,  Like you were as here as a decade is gone, Mouth poised to be a cave. To stab with fangs.  Open mouth, body coiled.    To set the hook.  With a jerk, my father tightens the line,  a flash of silver fighting  against his pull.    The impression left by a raptor’s wing.  Fierce talons pierce the night.  A scurry of soft prints, then excrement  enclosed by a brush-stroke of wings.  End mark on snow.    To slap with force.  My father hit me when he came home from work,  the back of his hand across my mouth.  My mother said I’d called her names.  He hit again. Again.    To cancel, cross out, delete.  I forget the names I called my mother,  but not my father’s hand.    A form of protest.  Sit-in, sit-down, slow-down, boycott, wildcat,  hunger. Hunger at my core.    Electric discharge between cloud and earth.  White coursing light splinters bark, splits  the heart of the black gum tree.    Aggressive action without warning.  You open the door at 3 a.m. Body coiled,  heart split, I hurl an empty bottle at the wall  above your head. Flash of silver.  Glass everywhere –  splinters on our bed.    To lower, take down, dismantle, surrender.  I’m the one sweeping bottle shards  into the recycle bin.    To move purposefully in a new direction.  I shove your clothes into paper sacks, set them  on the curb with last week’s news.  End mark on snow.         It lies on my doorstep belly up,  breast pale, twig-feet perched on air,  slate-hooded head tilted to the side;  a smear of down and blood on the window pane.    Moments ago, a trill of tickering notes,  flash of flint wingbeats hurtling  toward birch limbs, clouds, startling blue  splintered with light, body growing larger,  larger, filling dark eyes, then glass –    the self so clearly seen  just before the end. My mother’s legs are filthy. She is sun browned and dirt browned, the sweat gluing dust and clippings in rivulet patterns on her face, neck, arms. She has cut the grass, then quietly weeded the back flower garden, stretched on her side, like a cat daydreaming things you wouldn’t dare to know. Beside her, she’s arranged a colander, filled, roots and all, with curly docks. A single line of turned earth and Carlton butts points back to where she’s been.  To listen to me, she has stabbed her putty knife at parade rest into the ground before a deliberate row of soldier-straight polyanthus. Seeing her, I see now how no one ever loved the solace of the dirt like my mother. And I, newly licensed, have stopped her with my blather about a classic sputnik car at a used lot on Route 20. I say the words beautiful, spotless, tiny and like new. Though I suspect I’m speaking at the empty air, to answer me she smartly thumps the ground. Says, Goddamn. We’ve got to drive it.  Scrubbed, censored by Lifebuoy and Arpège, we present ourselves at closing time. The shaggy salesman wants to go, wants to say so without words, tilts his head, scratches, like a flea bit dog, at his neck, while my mom describes perfectly a car she’s never seen. Metropolitan, he says, A later one. Sold it today. Guy’ll pick her up tomorrow. He’s too relieved he can head for home. There’s a moment of no talking, but my mother can say something, standing slender, tall and silent in a summer dress.  He backs it out the bay, a two-tone compact for the Eisenhower age. Creaks open the door. We cannot drive someone else’s car. But see it? Sure. He leaves us alone, on the fabric bench with vinyl trim. My mother, unlike me, does not look fearful at the clutch. She takes the wheel with grace. Hers now, this old car that rolled off the line when she was twenty-eight and married near a dozen years with a kid as old as that, others close behind and more to come. Then, she could not imagine this, styled for a family that could think of second vehicles, or for a college girl, the one she never got to be, packing light for Florida to discover where the boys are.  The Metropolitan sits, like a frost berry white and Berkshire green stanza wrenched upon a page. Mom’s hand brushes slowly along the three on the tree. We have no keys. But we have ignition. Her lips move soundlessly, forming perhaps meanings for words like beautiful, spotless, tiny and new. I see mother seem other than either of us has ever known, see her, in that last instant unencumbered, driving all the unmapped routes there ever were, on pavement where we both agree it’s OK I don’t exist.       

At breakfast this morning  I set my fork on the rim of the plate  where it took on a life of its own.  It began to rock,  its tines on the downward sweep  nearly kissing the eggs,  the butter’s gold foil unwrapped  seemed to signal a gift,  a small miracle of physics  a rocking fork  as long as I watched. I heard a leaf faintly land,  touching down on the forest floor,  the white oak  holding it cleanly  above the quarter-moon scars  of its crosscut planes.  In the room  where I sleep and love  and sometimes read,  this is all I heard. A child, my mother showed  me the small closet of her self.  She stood there, child thin    in a shift-dress. Her blade  of tenderness, the pain of a blow  that made everything more colored–    her black-winged bangs  a blur of hands, pink-crush  that could take the wind out    and fill me with broken things.  This would take me to the winternight of a school  parking lot, where I was led to the shadow    of a lamplight post, the emptied classroom  windows darkened  from the want of children, ghost faces    seeking the same tenderness.  The cold flesh like a living thing,  a child’s body folded inside that living thing    and my tender knees,  the gravel that pierces them  to remind them how easy they cut,    the other working in his cutting  as if he sought to be buried  beneath my 15 years, the careful carving.    This is the kindness I have carried  inside like a birdhouse and its flurry  of wings, not even separate beatings    of hundreds of birds,  but a single thunderous pulse  that has found me, now,    holding my newborn daughter  in faintly lit dawn, her hair  like singed down between my fingers.    What can I  find  here?    Draw tenderness out of a cracked  well, imagine the stillness of water  in its silvery and solid room.    Yes, once my father brushed my hair  until the curls separated and frizzed,  its tangled rise beneath his dark hands,    comfort in their browned veins  when he held me against his ribs  as wind swept around us.    When he came home at dusk, I’d wait for the night  when he’d turn the pages to my book,  careful that I could see every page.    I rock her in my arms,  hum a tune with no melody,  my throat warming up    to match her small cry, a turn  for a turn, enough to last  the hour I rock her, its gentle tick and hurt. This is how I loved you: starved or bent over a toilet bowl. I loved you twenty pounds ago. I loved you in the arms of a man as long as he loved you, too. But even then, I sometimes did not. Even then, I bruised you, scratched you, sliced you, spoke darkly into you waiting for you to obey, punishing you when you did not.  This body, the only one I’ve got. How sick we have made each other.  I loved you when I was allowed, when no one was looking. I loved the good parts. I loved the soft and smooth of you. I loved your inner arms, your wildflower freckles, your small hands. I loved you at nine o’clock at night on weeknights when I went to bed hungry. I loved your emptiness. When the growls came, I dug my nails into your skin to silence you.  Where your fat hung, I could not love. Where your skin stretched, I could not love. Where you flaked, I could not love. These things are vile. Glorifying. Do not love them. Cover the roughness of an elbow, the reddened chin, the scarred nose.  I learned to love you sweater-hidden, baggy-jeaned. I loved you neck-up. I loved you ankle-down.  #  In girlhood, my body and I explored the leaping and bending of ourselves. The cartwheeled joy, the dance recital hula skirts. In the home videos I saw, I asked my mother about the bulging of my stomach.  “We’ll eat better, baby,” my mother said.  I othered myself. I split myself. Me against my body. Me against you. I distrusted you. Why did I not look like the other girls? What have you done to us?  #  This is what I learned from the boy at school: body deserving of being pushed down the stairs.  This is what I learned listening to the older girls: you will never forget the first time someone calls you ugly while you are hiding inside a bathroom stall.  This is what I learned watching my mother: eat the yogurt, eat the almonds. Say no to bread. Say no to dessert. Call your daughter to confess how much caramel popcorn you ate. Ask to be vilified for the hunger.  This is what I learned watching my mother: on the days your daughter says she is not hungry, congratulate yourself. You’ve won.  This is what I learned watching my mother: on the days your daughter feels betrayed by her body, paper the weight-loss articles across her bathroom mirror. Put her chocolate candy in the garbage disposal. Have her watch. Have her flip the switch. She will surely thank you.  #  There is a man who runs his fingers mutely down your back. His exploration scares you. What will he find if he touches us? What will he see when we are naked before him?  #  Body, bend for us. Make us smaller. Make us lighter.  #  This is what I learned watching my mother: the five-pound-loss has never made her prouder, no matter how we got there. No matter the full plates. No matter the growling stomach. No matter the vomit.  This is what I learned watching my mother: the emptiest girl wins.  #  For the body unloved: I’m sorry. I’m sorry for the blue and late nights, asking you to shrink. I am sorry for asking to see your bones. I loved you inconsiderately, conditionally. I am sorry for the razor-nicks, for the blood behind your knees, for your empty belly – morning and onward. I am sorry for the ugly names, for the threat of scissors. I am sorry for the pills that dried your mouth and kept you awake. I am sorry for the three-day binges of chicken broth and orange juice. I am sorry for the three-day binges of water and guilt. I am sorry.  Forgive me. This is all I have learned. I loved you the way I was taught. Forgive that grit of light for settling  where the pit used to be—fruit will be hollowed  and hollowed again. Forgive August for coming back  and seeming warmer than the last. It has no choice  but to seem. Forgive me for following you  at the Chevron in Crescent City and I’ll forgive you  for smelling like him. Sometimes absence tilts its head  like a loyal companion. Sometimes my hands  feel for dirt after rain. The summer you died I kept sleeping  on that sunbonnet quilt, legs stretched  on blue squares stitched by hands  with the same line maps as my own.  For weeks that room held me looking  at how light displaces itself in the early  morning before the house wakes its ghosts  with the smell of cheap espresso, how a  dresser sits in dust for years then one day  becomes a place for us to set the moving  on—a place for all our unloved, unessential  toiletries. But there are things I need to tell  you, Alice. I need to tell you how, when you  died, you still gave me fleas. How my skin  reddened and hollowed and I scratched  so hard I made myself bleed, how the doctor  said rash , how my mother said parasite,  how I said love , how I watched people swim  drunk at the lake, bodies hovering like moons  against licorice sky, how I scaled the fallen  tree like a tightrope, how I learned our love  has two mouths: one that draws blood  and one that drinks it. little light rises morning within morning  hands chafed clean from defile, knuckle  after knuckle pearled, bread  and boiled water, alive  and silent, as wind, as snow, muted  to two dark braids. yet    the innocence of thin limbs, winced  in the bathroom, rashed red  across her lovely back, penicillin  inside the animal she carries  pierced to her skeleton. night    within night anointed in hard breath  and the oiled smell of lubricant.  little light, eyes bleached in the ice  of his smile, no hand, no belt, just frozen sweat  and the sound of a doll drowning in snow. Between the Heaves of Storm    I emerge from a room of candles and coconut oil, my body  no longer mine, but covered with lilac layers  of saliva and ripened sweat.  I am pink stone dissolved in olives,  the kind of color that trembles, a glass of chianti, the wine  in my hand touched by other hands that also touch earthly things.  Under my feet the breath of ancient nations and every size and shape  of mushroom on my tongue, a blessing for the overtures of my body    and its beauty and where it leads me. I opened my whole life to find  this quintessence of the sacred and the senseless. Still  the crows cross this road on orange feet,  at night a blue fire burns over the city.  The grass   darkened still   bends to the wind,  and I will find the desert at the end of a road I know by heart. My mother kneeling  next to the hibiscus  with a little hand shovel  planting hyacinths  when I came to watch her.    I must have been seven or eight,  wide-eyed at the vague thing  flopping in her hand.  She reached in, fumbled  through the soil. When she found    the other half of the worm  she placed it at the base of a flower  to show me that it was still alive,  that both halves were working  on their own, wriggling    back to their underground world  to be useful:      It’s gorgeous in Boston today,  everyone is outside sunbathing  just like that day with the worm    and I know I had a dream about you  again. Or maybe it was your dream  and I was conjured to dwell there    so you wouldn’t be alone. Why  I anticipate forgetting the clouds  today, their shapes, how lifelike    they are when they drift…  why I remember the worm…  it has something to do with skin    and pink smokestacks. My palms  red before callusing  after working at a steer,  or dragging a heavy load…    Oh God, you hath given me two hands  but only one heart. For tonight, let’s forget those cellophane squares  jammed shamefully between the slats of the rattling air conditioner  sweetening the air with spearmint and horehound—    the kind of candies old men keep tucked  along the crease of monikered kerchiefs  and press into my palms as payment    for copies, or a smile, or the chance to brush by me  in the file room with their starched blue coats  scraping the rayon of my dress.   For tonight, let’s pretend this fluttering is the wings  of a thousand moths hanging here to taste dust  from the slats of the broken window unit,    not tokens of a currency in sweets  I have carried out since childhood.    Once, you accused me of building my own Point de Artes  along our bedroom wall. This was before we knew    the weight of too many gestures could  bring the footbridge down.

I cut my fingernails short,  scatter the clippings  like seeds, what  will grow from this?    Then, Savannah with her paper  waits to hear me say,  “My father left when I was very young.”  I cut my hair short,  keep it all for mulch.    Savannah in her coat.  Fresh dairy,  geese flying north again.  Lilies for eyes.  Lilies for everything. What hangs in the light is all—a fine dry powder, if I could  gather, you wouldn’t fill a jug meant for milk.  To think, we made more ash  than the body. How you returned to quiet    and earth. In the window, a slant—to bury  the dead is to keep in my lungs; of dust at its most  still, nothing settles—a fine dry  powder, if I could gather you. Here, Body,    I am sorry for the clothes  in which I marveled at your dragged form    for the first time, borrowed unbeknownst, from the body  that would come to burrow her kneaded fingers into your—skin,    an open wound in which nothing pretty stays on  long enough. Our queer, quiet as the bones    I place on our tongue. Body, I want to give  back to you our mother, when she said she hopes    I can get to before—and I can only bring you  to tell her there is no before    to remember. I swallow your hands  as a rat snake to keep their shaking    in, and fold them from the pyre’s shadow  of her flesh. Here, body, I am sorry for the ash,  and how I have tried to return to it through you. I Hope, An Orchard    As it opens, still, my mouth fields  her long ghost spit pushed  against my teeth. It was not hard  for her, I know, because she said  she does not remember. The way she held me down  on our grandparents’ couch. There was a meadow    cindering on my tongue. How, even  if she cannot recall, arson  buries all sound but the dead popping  at the heat. And here, perhaps    an orchard is beginning, as they do,  or, at least, as I hope to have heard,  that beautiful things can grow after  all but the soil seems to be gone. The way he said come here . Kissed the tip of my shoulder.  Bare now. The dress strap slipped. Deck of cards stacked  into a pyramid on the porch table, our weathervane. No wind.    Means when the school bus groans to a three o’clock stop  in front of our house, we will hear the blur of honeybee chatter  from the windows and think wisteria .    How the botanist said the seeds will sprout, but might never  bloom. But how they vined and dipped mischievously  underground. Choked the wood post that crutches our land.  Clockwise. Rooted, breaths-away from where we planted it.    (The small stone in my belly, vein-dry.)  We ’ll try again . His whisper collarbone-thin.    I grip a pad of steel wool to buff the rust spots on our shears.  Then cradle the sharp edges in soapy water, my fingers pale as milk.    I float a handful of the violet clippings in a steel pot,  sprinkle soda ash, leaves and stems, soak a dress overnight,  the silk staining morning soft—yellow bled into green. No more messages in amber and celadon bottles,  or letters full of bees    smoked out of glued envelopes, stamped  with gargoyles from your corner of hell.    Oui , you are the navigator of this small boat.  Yes, the silver needle on the compass points true north.    Non , the sun is not temporary.  Oui , the moon is a mountainous eye with a vision.    Look, already you are asleep  inside the body of the mother    in your dreams.  Yes , you will be delivered.          Daughters tell lies. We are lovelier  this way. So I say: the snow sprawls  softly in the morning. And my mother  believes me. Ice the color of robin eggs  in the right light. Yes, the trails are nice,  the woods angled out to the river. A buck  treads quietly through the cemetery, his  eyes locked on a single grave. The usual  questions: are you warm enough, are you  writing? And the answers: yes, yes, fine,  and fine. Do you hear the river, Mother?  It surges even under all that weight.  Is the moon brighter there? she asks.  But I stop here—the moon is no beacon.  The night’s a mug shot, and the tub is full.  I relive the man, the man, the man, how he  held onto me in Ohio, how he sowed me  through and through. I am warm only here,  searing my skin in bathwater, the radiator  my only witness. Do you hear the water,  Mother? She talks of spring, how the wild-  flowers will soon burst from under the grip.  O, the rock nettle! O, the evening primrose!  Yes, here, too. Though the ice grows thicker  on the river and the bluebirds are buried  deep in the snow. The watch-fires receded.  The angle of the sky was a murmur.  You went outside and shot a pig.    Here, now, I have no blood  or water from the river.  I hold my hand up to the sky  and smile.    You have God in your pants-pocket  and an animal skin.  The lamp is lit and dreaming,  the corn is burning in the barn,  my mouth is dust and star-stuff.    I couldn’t call you home. Still it’s snowing, and they have coffee. They put on their pants and shirts and do things to their faces. She craves a cigarette—quit months ago, but there’s a pack hidden in her underwear drawer next to the Bible. She has one, and the taste of ash and smoke in her mouth is almost too much. She says out loud: Who am I to deserve this? What have I done? What will I do?  The snow stops. Through the house’s one small window, in the distance, they see something coming over the hills—some altitudinous beast that hadn’t been there the last time they looked. Except they knew that it had. It may not be nice to be good, little 6655321. It may be horrible to be good. And when I say that to you I realize how self-contradictory that sounds. I know I shall have many sleepless nights about this. What does God want? Does God want goodness or the choice of goodness? Is a man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than a man who has the good imposed upon him? Deep and hard questions, little 6655321.  –Anthony Burgess    Drains throat more  than water—spiraling soap, hair,  dirt, grease, cleanser, champagne  grapes, spit, toothpaste,  and other bits of waste we launch  earthward. We know well enough,  standing in the slime of refusing-  to-empty tubs, lowering hands  into murky dishwater to finger  out clogs—no matter how we malign  people and actions, we connect with  the suck of energy. We need  the drain’s down so we can clean up. Sometimes the gospel is turnt–  the choir a synchronized dab  & the church bows their heads  over & over  on beat  like the war is over  or just beginning.  It’s something bout that bass line  behind an open bottle of hallelujah  that reminds all the saints  the devil is off beat  AF  & grimy with it–  How is the war ever over  when saints still think Jesus  was off beat too? Like he ain’t prophesize  Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik &  gave it to the hood as gospel–  like these ebonics not sacred? A scripture?  How we stay saved?      Sometimes the turnt is gospel–  the twerk a ghost  that can’t be shook–  the block party a grill  filled with communion–  what blood have we shed to eat ribs whole?  How much wine is soaked up by graves?  When the beat drops  so do our burdens, the  code switches back to nigga &  some people think it don’t take all that–  think we need to behave ourselves  like God ain’t gift us survival instincts  like these hands can’t knuck and pray.  The turnt is testimony. The blessing  Is how God fills our cups to the brim &  we drink & lift every voice  in chorus. After a mighty fine rogering  I think about that fellow, Roger.  Peter made out all right, and Dick.  How did they luck out so much more  than John?    I start to think about my part in it all.  I gave him the old Belinda? Nope.  (Don’t say old, my inner Cosmo quails.)  It’s got to be a common name.  Not Virginia.    Likewise, Mary, Magdalena.  You are such a Beth! (Not working)  I showed him my Jennifer. Closer?  He got all up in my Ruth and Ester.    Vajayjay is someone afraid to say  vagina. I do like honey pot.  and sugar bowl, as affectionate  pet names. I’m meh on pussy,  that workhorse.    For years I used geography:  Look, you can see all the way to Kansas!  Alternatively, familiar places—  So sorry, the pool is closed.    I’d dish out better with a name,  something with legs. I flashed him my —  Amelia? Still wedded to vanished Earhart.  Besides, we need a name that vibrates,  likes to verb.    We sallied around, all the long afternoon.  That might do. There’s sally and Mustang Sally  both slow and fast. She knows her own mind.  Not too many syllables  and she drives. Let me tell you, it takes some discipline  to leave the phone be when I think of him,  the grifting boyfriend who lives still in her house.    Last time I called, a woman picked up the phone.  I heard about his plans to marry again,  his love for the woman’s daughter. What a feeling!    Call me small, but I don’t want to know  if he ever married that woman same age as me.  I don’t want to know what plants she grows,    or if she ever tried on that dress he kept.  Has she thrown out my mother’s dishes? I don’t know.  Has she painted the cabinets? Read her unpublished poems?    He said the girl loves reading. She’s got my books.  I hope she finds my Edna St. Vincent Millay.  I hope this, though I do not know her name,    that she reads those poems and finds in them that strength,  that verve, that edge that she (though I don’t want to know)  will need to get through those drunken afternoons,    the blurry nights, the quiet quiet mornings  and patient reassembly of herself.  Though I don’t want to know it won’t be enough,    (and I know it won’t), I hope I left behind  enough of me that he could not wipe out  all traces of the girl who did survive.    When I said my name, when she handed over the phone,  Why are you calling here? That was a surprise.  In his suicidal months, I phoned each day.    My absence is like the kitchen microwave.  Empty, handy, always standing ready.  I’m not such a fool to think the man has changed.          1.  Hazard lights in the breakdown lane—  three semis stuck halfway up Searsburg Mountain,  the state trooper bending to set flares    on treacherous ice roads winding slow  East/West over the ridge  where my mother is re-learning how to knit.    Her marled stitches furl into a ribbon,  loose scarf for an imaginary child, another  project she’ll never finish. She carries    the soft cowl from room to room,  couch to chair, with the mystery  she’s been reading since August.      2.  Why aren’t the windmills turning when we pass?  They razed the ridgeline but those giant blades  stand sentinel above the riddled snowpack.    Tension is just trapped energy , the teacher says,  rubbing the knot at the nape of my neck.  I want to believe her, I breathe    into the interstices, imagine  I’d be different with a different man,  would soften like a rag beneath his grip.      3.  Out on the Meadows, the fishermen arrive  in darkness, live bait in lidded buckets.  They light the woodstove in the metal house,    bore a hole through the ice  revealing the netherworld: murky reeds  and black mud, the promise    of slow perch in cold water.  They hook a minnow below the dorsal fin  and it swims around the hole all day    tethered to an invisible line, battering  the smooth walls. The only way out  is to be consumed, the only freedom a mouth    darker and colder than this frozen river. The night unspooled slow as a ripple  on a reed-choked pond, thick with the unsaid unsung  questions what if why not what if how come?  tiny mouths like fish nipping the surface    teasing the moon out of the treetops.  Belly-down in soft grass did I watch  a honeybee burrow into the tip of a foxglove  and imagine your hands again love    indecent at my little twilight tryst?  Lace panties, a book, a beer and a candle…  I read and wrote and dozed but didn’t text  you here. Promises kept, good girl    go swallow summer hand over fist  sweet basil, sungolds, like this  like this. Take, for instance, this spider.  Some see an hourglass  on her stomach  or a bright eye peering  through a door into hell. Others  see fire just beyond  a stand of spruce  turning a hillside to ash.  But I see a red compass arrow  sweeping a dark sky  making an X as it searches  North, as if correcting the stars  beginning to take shape in the night.  I didn’t know I could fear  something as small as this—  that I would wake  feeling the soft-as-nothing touch  in my hair, down my chest,  and legs, and run my hands  over the cold sheets  and blanket and remember  I was alone. I didn’t know  I would see dew  caught in a web as a spider  floated between a cage of grass  on a wind you wouldn’t believe  existed, and understand  she had been there all along  working to mimic  an unfinished pattern  for everything. Today I’m watching the sundown while the moths memorize my face—  like a person learns the histories of a lover’s scars—they carry it with them    back through the wet leaves and into the forest. Unlike the sky, you could count  the lights across the mountainside. Past them more lights, and further    the constellations. I used to know the names for them. I used to remember  the sound of my father asleep on a twin bed beside me, the timing belt in his breath.    Is it OK to talk about him this way—passed out as if he is here and not here—flesh  and blood in the room he grew up in. His pockets emptied: the cigarette packs,    and orange pill bottles, the nasal spray, and scratch-offs casting shadows on the desk  where he used to sit and watch the white petals of the cherry tree fall from the branches.    The right words never came to bring up our past—to speak through the silence  shared between father and son. I don’t know what makes something sacred    or worth retelling—but as the moths go deep into the woods I’m left staring  at myself as if in another world. I see how alike    we’ve become in his absence. Both eyes flicker in the reflection—two taillights  aglow at rush hour where we’re stuck in traffic headed back to his rented apartment    where he’ll spread Stan’s Pimento Cheese on bread to make us sandwiches  for dinner. He won’t notice me watching him, wondering how his hands manage such care.    In my twenties I’ve know only a little regret and misfortune—unlike him  whose whole life was hard and miserable. Even as we chew he’s only got a year to live    though no one would suspect. The night it happened he tried to call me  but I was getting drunk with a friend on dollar beer—mostly Pabst and Coors    and Sweetwater pulled from the tin-tub. I remember the brown glass, ice shaking  in a plastic cup, Andres and Chandler gambling at the pool table—the cue ball so blued    with chalk, the felt worn and stained. I drove home buzzed and happy. Once in a while  I return to that day as if to the scene of a crime—the arsonist’s desire    to see the smoke and ruin clear in the afternoon sunlight—  to walk across the blackened beams and admire whatever    survived. To inhale cinder. To not forget. The night before the funeral  I carve his face out of the dark  with an outstretched finger  scraping through the wreckage of dusk  on the window-glass and over  the hunched frame of a storm  ruined hay-barn.    It’s 2012, the year the world ends.  The grackles widen over hornbeam  like notes on sheet music  at the far edge of the land. Once,    my mother took me  away from my father  below the quarter-truce  of the moon. She drove  a ‘76 AMC Gremlin,  ready to be junked and forgotten  by the time I was born.  There is no need    to go back. To watch the sun rise  in the side-view mirror  as if the bright-painted steel  of a Ferris Wheel in a traveling fair.  There’s a night that sleeps  and a sky for darkness, and for burial,  for ash, and flight.  Overlooked is a Compound Word    A child’s croup-thick cough, barked alarum bell,    wakes me as I wash with night’s long tide.  I shiver, stand to dress, then hover    at the chest, over the breath, of my sleeping child.    In the city’s soundscape, gunfire, perhaps, snaps.  I tell myself it was far away or, better yet,    it was a car, a firecracker, steel slapping train tracks    ten streets away. Back in bed, I list thin walls, bullets,  faulty wiring, bronchioles small as sand    under my daughter’s ribs. I dream of a girl    with moon-white hair and the long fingers  of a saint praying in an old painting.    Invisible, she is adrift in a crowded cafeteria,    an inarticulate ache in her wake.  By light of day, I live again,    drop my daughter off at school and, mist lifting,    find the scarf I lost last week looped around a fence end  by some thoughtful passerby, its pattern a talisman only to me.    I think it had been there for days.    I did not see it and then I did:  rain-faded and familiar as my own hand. This is how to move quick so that it doesn’t fall on you —Jamaica Kincaid    In my students’ essays,  it is still the long holiday in Iran.    Mother is still alive.    She hangs tea towels out to dry  in a summer house built over a river,  the name of which cannot be translated.    Cool air flows through the floorboards.    Closer by, on Craig Creek,  bass gather in the catalpa tree’s shade.    Blossoms fall on the water.    At edge of a refugee camp,  a little boy catches grasshoppers for his brother’s chickens,  proud of the fat ones, big as his hand.    The Bued (meaning Holy Water ),  the most beautiful river in the Philippines,  is now polluted, but bathers and dolphins  and gleaners of fish once slid through warm shadows.    My mother was on the phone  and, then, she wasn’t.    The day my Paw Paw died.  The day my father died.  The day my grandfather died.    In the picture I am writing about,  she sits on that yellow couch I always remember,  wrapped in the shawl we gave her.    We didn’t know the brain tumor made him fall.  We didn’t know he was leaving until he did.    He was drinking wine out of a straw.  He was watching the Steelers play.  He was dying in the basement  and I went upstairs to get away.    Daddy pressed my face into the rug,  Saturday morning cartoons on the TV.  I fought back.  I fought even harder when it was my little sister.    Here is how you dye your hair.    Here is how you feed an old person.  Here is how you get your child up in the morning.  Here is how you make bread over a Sterno flame.    The lions waited in the grass.    We all walked together through the night.    You will know the chicken is done  when the meat is no longer pink.    Here is how you gut a deer.  Here is how you bury the guts.    I have a four-month-old baby.    I have a baby in the grave.    Her house always smelled of lemons.    We floated down the James River in canoes.  We slept on warm rocks, where, later, we learned  rattlesnakes liked to gather.    They drafted me after the war was done.  My job was to load the bodies.    I watched my sister’s eyes watch me.  The bonfire danced.    The sand burned my feet.    I had butterflies in my stomach.    Pretty soon he was drinking all day.    Words cannot describe.    Today I am here  because I survived.    My mother watches my child.    I follow the recipe,  but it doesn’t taste the same. The definition of metaphor  is the transfer of burden,  so pay attention.    There is the heron of my longing:  the curve of neck, stilt of legs,  blue, breakable, prone to flight.    The summer of my certainty:  lit with streaks of a fox’s tail  slipping back into the woods.    The house of my mother’s madness:  worn front steps lost  to waist high weeds and debt.    Now watch a small bird building  her nest inside a watering can,  darting each piece of straw through    the one round opening.  Imagine a young chick learning  to fly by launching itself skyward,    the stunned drop to the bottom,  rattle of wings inside metal,  mocking blue coin of sky,  and name it.  I live in the city.  If it doesn’t rain again this season,  farms in the delta will die.  The warming has already fucked up  the food chain in the ocean  and patterns of migratory birds.  The big fish are nearly gone.  I’m 45 years old: how many  more winters, how many rains?  In the late sun of my studio  I write to my niece, a child  who paints and takes ballet.  She’s four decades behind me.  What good are these words,  if they can’t call up a spell for her  to make it rain and seed the arid earth  deep and green, the way it was  in endless bloom before us? The flesh of a summer buck in the stew  on the stove of my father’s drinking buddy    gives off a scent of pain fused with cloves  like a hint of red wine that burns residually    or a bruise found next day upon waking.  I close my eyes and feel the hairline fracture    of morning dew cold in the pretty buck’s lungs,  the dirt pasty and black in the dingle beside a stream    as the candelabra of antlers rakes the air.  When my name is called like the bone bead    of an abacus pushed against its row, I enter  the room of plaid-shirted men — overweight    and unshy, they laugh with bottles of beer  like green cocks in their hands. And then    my father, drowning beneath the glass leaves  of the chandelier, recounts the kill.          Overcome with wool and book dust  yet bloomed milky from the eye of a cough,  you leave no fingerprints on the hardbacks,  a first edition Melville perpetually open  in your tweedy tweedy lap to the same page  that makes you ponder the vast and unknowable  sea beyond the bottle bottoms of your  glasses. To be trapped somewhere  between assuage and vetiver ,  to be the mug of tea half drunk and always hot.  Virgin in the library, you were born  with the essential questions quiet in your mouth  in a shaft of light at Dewey 700.3,  tilt of your heart-shaped head,  the Prell sheen of your hair—  chestnut, acorn, oh the hues of brown—  you are the single page culled from the binding.  The Western canon heaves above  though you are weightless in your awe,  your petal-folded legs.  Equal parts naivete and knowledge,  all is asked that you empty and fill  at once, that you station the hall of dead  grammar. If you stand up, what hunger  will answer for you?  If you cup your ear into the bright silence,  a bolt of hooves red in their thunder  are wresting from the stone  capital, their velvet bodies can hear  the fierce meter of your mind. Inside the dark, hot potbelly  of my uncomfortable mother,    I stirred in pink au jus. In salty  amnio, I grew round, delicious    and thick. My silky ears pickled.  My knuckles and cloven hooves    prickled with finicky hungers.  All new senses of me glorious    tongues budding and licking.  I crackled to life and I kicked her    beneath the floating ribs: Eat,  eat, Woman! Eat! But she halved    grapefruits. She hard boiled eggs.  She sipped thin, bitter black coffee    with no sweet cream. Pained  by the weight of me, she signed    her pregnancy photos in shame.  “Don’t I look terrible?” she asked    the world. She decided early on  to name me, Fat—an inside joke    between her and my father.  And he agreed. Consider a house shamed in white siding on a hill near forest park and the zoo. Not near Clayton and McCausland, not central to light in our city, but shaken by Manchester’s trains. Reckon this house was frayed stories, full of sound eager kids who liked Goethe, drums, guitars. Tucked in shag steps, warped wood lining. Imagine electric sparks when you turn on night light. Perhaps home is only the beginning, square rooms for us to tend. See giving over this house, watching it burn. Love comes with carnage, under alatus bushes and broken dolls, in dreamcatchers, under letters to god. I built snakes from rocks, ash and clay–looped them round pepper stalks, eggplant vines, red bricks. Today was harder.   I was barely a creature,  my fangs filed down, my claws jagged and caught in the carpet.  I took a lot of comfort  in the misfortune of others.  My favorite colleague resigned  so I claimed his office chair, its lumbar supports  and adjusting swivel—  Oh Lord, it feels good to just be comfortable  with this tail, these scales, these feathers.  Clothes never fit them right.  I can never find enough meat to satisfy,  never enough heat to keep January from my bones.  I will be asked to recant  my statement as soon as I’m in the company of others,  the ones holding batons, wearing jackboots,  wearing the blue costumes of the bored.  The stories of salvation are boring—  it’s all a lot of bread  and dirt and daguerrotypes,  a sort of heaven for great-grandparents.  We’re taught early on to want what we do not want,  to treasure what we can always have.  Vegetables before we leave the table,  fluoride in the water.  I was in the future most of yesterday  but now I am in the past tomorrow.  The director tells me to figure it out,  to find the emotion, but I’ve found so much of it  that I’ve chosen to cease feeling entirely.  I’m chewing the scenery,  clawing the black sheet over the window to shreds. At this point, land disappears into a tail,  a serpent with forked tongue,  scales, eight muscled legs.    Here be the unexplained mysteries  of the universe. Here be the radiant truth  of claw and wretchedness.    Ships cannot help but sail around capes  to arrive in the mouths of beasts.  Sailors cannot escape their dark eyes.    Here be the unmappable,  the crags and cliff-faces of something  gloomy and afflicted.    Here be the stories we tell ourselves.  Here be the stories we tell ourselves  we need to survive. I am on the road watching an imaginary flood, the river bringing tree parts, headless fish.  Ask me where I was last night and I’ll tell you the dogs dwell out in the barn, they cower and chew dust.  Turn the hourglass over. It sifts every plea, our prayers, the rain we sang for today, the first Psalm.  Here is moonlight ragged on the leaves in the dying breeze.  I’ve drawn a line in red across the belly of spring. A bus floats past reminding me I am always on the outside wishing for a ride to the place where we can water the grass.  They ask what’s the point—a life cycle  bookended by shit, all for a vacation inside  your black and shiny body.    But hasn’t everyone wanted to be  someone else for a while? Smudged  the line between enchanted and enchained?    Instead, ask what I wouldn’t give  to trade my unremarkable white smoothness  for your coppery strength,    your thorned and devilish charm,  and the ability to fly—just briefly—  grasped in the safety of your body.    I really am sorry my presence  curdles your defenses, thins your tough armor  to this useless linament layer,    a barely-there barrier  between me and the fantasy  of what it’s like to be you.    If there were another way, I’d take it.  I’d leave you tough and uneaten.  I’d leave you flying. Myrmeconema neotropicum is a nematode that infests South American gliding ants. Once infected, the ant’s small black gaster expands and reddens until it looks like a ripe berry. The ant alters its behavior, foraging further than uninfected ants and elevating its berry-like gaster so a bird is more likely to spot the ant and eat it, continuing the life cycle of the parasite.    You slipped like a breath into my body,  shocked my black bright. Though I’d dreamed  of such singular acknowledgement, I let you beg  for my blessing,  and as your blip of a body  sank into mine, I absorbed your compliments  about work ethic, adaptability, my unparalleled  strength like a memory I’d always wanted to make.    We glided through the thick wet, the air like an ocean,  my legs flared like the freaky wings of a never-been.  I watched my family march into jaws and beaks,  the scent of warning deep in my gut like a famine.    Soon, you moved into my spacious globe  the thin tunnel of your body couldn’t offer.  As you thickened with eggs, leaves pressed veiny  prints on the soles of my feet, and you lounged,  sway-backed and swollen, cozy in my core.    When it was time, you bulbed my gaster  with your thousands, sent it bobbing in a fit of crimson.  They’ll say you made me do it. Lament the loss  of a such a strong worker, claim my contribution  as significant as any. But as I sauntered like a drunk  to the edge of the world, rested my jaw on a leaf,  shoved my ass skyward, I watched myself from the inky orbit,  a miniscule point of light and color,  a solitary offering to the unforgiving expanse.    the wind here  has a different sort of color  a color like your hair  like wild horses  and a heartbeat that is risingGrandfather’s face looked like a tree  and we were made of the same thing.  Me: an event  that was occurring.  Him: an event  that was going to happen.  The night then was less alone,  she held thousands of stars on her skirt.  I was as afraid of death  as I was of myself,  as I had been of a loose tooth  at the age of seven.    When Grandfather fell on his side  the citrus and cardamom were still in the air.  A bridge was an event  with two beginnings,  its back closer to God.    Time, peculiar like magic or poetry,  taught me how the seed of a cherry  can sometimes grow into a maple tree,  can be built into a bridge  with an arch high enough for someone to walk along  and pluck God right out of heaven. A cavalcade of melon-bellied women  undiscernible ankles  and engorged fingers  chirp and chatter  over colors, costumes, and colleges      The mother in law iced the towering cake with grandbabies clutching at her ankles. “I had four babies within six years. My life had meaning then, truly . There is nothing like being a mother.” She lifted her ill-fitting blouse to reveal a battlefield of stretch marks. Her proof that she had done it, like everyone else.      Here is your map.  Here are your tools.  You know your objective?  Good. Go.    I remember the smell of your soft hair after your daily bathing. Lilac and baby powder. It was like Heaven. I missed it when you were old enough to bathe yourself. Like it was a connection I was no longer given privilege to. You wouldn’t remember it, but I do. All the time.      Segue through gelatin  down the tunnel  and make a right  loop around    “You’ll change your mind”  “No”  “You’ll regret it”  “No”  “It’ll happen by chance”  “No”      Ward off  the ovarian beasts  and remove the invader—  received an invite  but outmanned the barrier      She embraced one of the sweetest darlings she had ever beheld. She rocked her until her arms fell asleep but the gentle, joyous cooing still lingers lovingly in her mind.      lubed and prodded    carved and canaled    scooped and scraped    What to expect when you’re not expecting?  Heil Hitler became the way people said hello, goodbye, goodnight to their children before turning low the light. It became what couples exchanged instead of kisses in doorways. How businessmen sealed a deal over cigars. What conductors said when the train was leaving the station. The semaphore of the birds breaking over the city, the Morse Code of fireflies in the vineyards summer evenings. Though if you look at the photographs, watch any movie, it is winter in Germany. It is winter for years. Because who can imagine walking in the Rhineland in the sparking blue afternoon, brushing a hand over the rough hewn wheat as you pass, shoes wet in the grass, coming on a group of children, picking the small cherries which grow wild before the crows can get them. Picking the cherries and looking up to say Heil Hitler when they see you approach, teeth dark red from the fruit. She never came—rusty-dirt  color the size of a warning just  a crush in the cotton panties,    I was not pregnant (te dijé), but  you wanted to know. What happened  the last time I had missed three  months of bloated warmth,  salty red-tide.    Sometimes I see the eggs like  smallish, grey, pebbles clattering  through me. Is a dead tumor more  fibrous than an egg? If a tumor is  there, does an egg lose its place  in line?    On the back of my retina, I can see  my great grandmother, standing. She  is within the tin, plywood, and metal  mesh of a coop. Hands akimbo.  Scrutinizing the hen that can’t  cluck anymore.    She lifts the fatty bag of feathers and rolls  the cheek of her palm over the  pelvic floor before she crouches  down and says to me, “Hold this.”    And I do. I do. Hold it firm because  I am more frightened of a smack,  and popping hot grease, and her  not loving me, than I am    when she takes the short razor from  her french roll of hair, and slits open  the pelvic floor of the hen. She rolls  her hands around its body until the  eggs roll dryly over the ground.    And. Then. And Now. I was. I am.  More afraid of not having eggs  because of being raised in a history  of hunger. Than I ever was of that. When I ate the butterfly, I  stalked it by the hibiscus—like a stray cat,  the wings melted to my tongue  like triangles of silk.  When my aunt caught me,  she pinched my jaws as if I were a snake,  and said,  Someday that will be someone’s wherewithal,  down in there.    My aunts—grand or otherwise, were not surprised  when on a summer day, too hot for hurricane,  I ate the white cubes  hiding under my great aunt’s chair,  mistaking her white clay for a white fudge.    The river mucus, the hill blood squished  wetly with my spit between my teeth. Maybe  this orbit of aunts, my mother there, but still  an aunt to someone, know the secret  to eating dirt, or are just that hungry.    I spy a cricket in the corner and snatch its  greenness in my jaws. It creeks one last  time before I look up from my haunches.  There is a broom stick at my funeral mound  of a belly, my aunt asks me,    Just what is so hungry  down  in  there?  Amanda Bubble evanesces, is ephemeral, is the empress of ice cream in the swelter of July. She is filmy, all shimmer and wobble. A sharp look destroys her. She is the fragility of the shell around the embryo of the eaglet, dreading the tiny beak and its pip , pip , pip .        Sometimes when I am walking I wonder if there is blood coming out of my ears    As I think about the red spilling from those little spouts, I always remember the dream about William when he was sick; not the one where the sky falls apart like wet cardboard boxes, but the dream where he is sitting in the rocking chair and there is a hole in his neck.  The hole in his neck is clean and sharp, like a button, black and sewn with black thread. In the dream, William is both alive and dead at the same time.  There is another dream where William is a little boy. It is understood that he is a ghost. It is the dream where he haunts me in the bathroom of my first house. Somehow, the white tiles and the soapy light through the window resemble his childish form.  But I don’t believe in ghosts. I think that his death was the last thing. Sometimes when I am walking, I have a hard time imagining his last moment: the one just before. That moment must have been a fiction. It must have been a very long story. Last night the moon took me back  in its discipline  as if light could restore what I’d carefully set aside.  The window flickered its lace.    I leaned on my white pillow,  with the white sheet across the map of my body.  The luminous peered through  in eddies, and settled its fine blooms.    Last night, the moon was plump.  My bed ridden by lightness. Down the hill, some cows are staggered in a field,  just fleecing off the cold.    An hour and an hour.  Beside the road, mountains keep rising  in the rotten unrelenting.    The screaming wind continues to make us frail.  I sweep the cold against the doorframe.    It is the hundredth day, or more. Another sad one.    We know our immediate neighbors’ names.  We used to nod but now we hustle past  and pull inside—watch the deliberate fist of it.    Across the dirt, a coyote passes the old logs.    We sip stale soup.  Night husks to drifting snow. Every year, trees redeem their leaves,  the sky slung to our neighbor’s stones.    Finches are bewildered by wind, reiterating  each feathered plummet.  Echinacea musk and rosemary  alter the drifting smoke of piñon — autumn already  decomposing, each blade  of cactus standing.    Winter’s measure:  thin wires inked with articulate crows.    The ground is almost the horizon,  pouring out its oscillations.    A room of gray sweaters. Blueberries  up from the freezer. I am damned close to the edge  because this golden Asperger’s boy  was assigned a three-page term paper  on Purgatory. Rather than write it, he bites  his nails as I try to channel him through the grand  array of human experience. He wrenches his feet  back and forth. It’s impossible to explain  that someday he too may be teetering  to a long ago gap. How can I say, As you sway  in hard-scrabble history, stay steady  for Cerberus and his rough rows of dark  teeth, the matted fur. Do not fear the crowding. Sit  pinned to night . He twirls his hair in his right hand.  He asks a pointless question, one filled with the enormity  of existence. I’m impatient, and he’s in no hurry  to think through the future of his past. We pretend  his mind is not blurred with life’s strongest  currents, that he knows lamentation and cold,  when instead he has changed course  to a track meet on Tuesday and his family’s trip  to Alaska this summer—Will they see elk? From the endless  abyss, I nudge him and he scrutinizes  the window. We’re reaching the irreducible  deadline. What will it take for him to hunch  in the innermost, to imagine he’s in a stained boat  on a backdraft of previous days? Oh, to hell with it!  It’s like having three heads, doing this tutoring job  with a boy in his reveries. Just as I give up, he looks to the side  without seeing, and says astrally So… , inching around  his unnavigable thoughts as he often does. He intones  with a voice thick and wrestled, The ferryman will pull an obolus  from our weeping eyes, showing each of our sins.  This 16-year-oldon the verge of failing his classes  tells me, We have to yield up our runneled faces .  He shrugs and looks off. Then we sit in what is left  of winter, and the air seems fated with silence,  but still, it’s made of air.                   We have terrible senses of direction and neither of has learned how to turn the ignition to leave our bodies behind. So we walk, but never in a straight line. You blame your poor balance on being born premature; I blame mine on alcoholism. But I often think we are saying the same thing. I say, this life is tightrope and you hand me a balancing pole, which is really a tube of black cherry lipstick, sometimes liquid eyeliner. I tell you, my guilty pleasure is Tudor style homes and I think it’s because I’m afraid to be made of just one thing. You know me well enough to know what hurts and where. Queer, what you have in your hair is all down feathers, dandelion stems, and the ways in which you’ve saved me. When we take new names, we give each other permission. Call it cell division . Call it asexual reproduction . Call it we sexier now . I say I want to turn my body into a straight line. And you chant until it’s true: Kayla/Kayleb/Chris/Kit. You ask have you practiced yourself in cursive? Have you touched yourself yet in ink? We allow greed when we are together, because greed, to us, is the only way to stay alive. When I can’t see, your names bobby pin the hair from my eyes. When I can’t taste, I take the lipstick off your lips with my lips. If imitation is the highest form of flattery, mimicry is me saying I love you . I am you. I overdress to be outdoors. Pork pie. Right-handed buttons. Black tie slack lined down my chest. Nobody has died, but somebody has died. & I want to remember her name so I can swiss army carve it into bark, so I can say a word above her grave, set deep and bellied in an uprooted tree. White birch, genderless swatch, sloughing to pinkraw. Roots reach for sky—tongues still try to catch rain. I know half of what it means to die slowly. To feel specific thirst. If this is a rural funeral, I’ll turn the sunflowers to lampposts, the mountain to a procession of wrecked black cars, wet pine metallic, rubber burning. I’ll turn my hands urban, my body man. My wallet will brim with opposites, a prayer card with a girl’s name, psalm I’ll feel in what’s left of my womb. What is it to visit your own grave? To die & be more alive than ever? I want to tell me I miss me. I want to tell me, I’m never coming back. [I]    Waltz and waltz, but mostly I sit  still with sound    Of course, of course  The horizon begins with my body.

My boss says, Go home.  I wait, office door closed,  think to phone friends, don’t.  My window looks on sky-  scrapers wreathed in fog.  I put on my hat, coat, and gloves,  and leave.  I roam the Loop  and wander into Marshall Fields.    This year’s  summer fashion features  Hawaiian prints,  shocking pinks and purples.  The dressing room mirror  is a parallel universe,  my reflection a stranger  in a flowered muumuu.    The smiling sales associate  asks me where I’m going,  remarks on what a relaxing trip  I’m going to have.    I buy four shopping bags  full of fuchsia frippery,  sleeveless dresses,  frou-frou swim suits,    Who cares, spend it all.  The world has come to an end. Each day, the electrons grow tired of resembling each other so completely and edge—as a group—toward properties. “Red,” one says, but since they are identical, no one knows who said this and they adopt it as their collective stance. “We should like to be red,” they say in unison.  And they paint themselves red, but as redness is only a phenomenon of light interacting with atoms, of which electrons are only a part, the electrons realize, one by one or as a group (no one can tell), that they can’t be sure whether they have become red at all.  “I was hoping for a change,” one says. But since all electrons are identical, it is unclear which of the electrons is most disappointed about their failed attempt to distinguish themselves.  Something keeps escaping them.  They agree that they are relatively light particles and that they often occupy orbitals in atoms. But this is not enough.  “We have charge,” one says.  “And spin,” another adds.  “I hear the stars can be told from each other,” one electron says. “That some are old and some are young, some are larger than others, some are destined for collapse or explosion. That each star has a composition, like a fingerprint.”  “This is what we lack,” says another electron, whose thoughts are so attuned to the first it is as if they share one mind. “We are not composed of anything but ourselves.” In some ways we’ve moved to the desert, in others  we’ve been sentenced. The thorn of me  when his kisses bloom. The barkflesh    of palo breas a wrung green, supplicants  who mimed for water so pathetically  they moved themselves, forgot their thirst    and became intent on gesture. I’ve never known  what to do with my hands. But I can make space  inside myself, a succulent, and drink slowly. I can wait    until I duplicate. I’m a cactus in reverse. It hurts.  It doesn’t hurt. It’s time to click bottle tree  castanets with the children. A muster    of peafowl roost on the library roof. Our eyes dart from drab  to glam, hen to cock. They descend  from a pair brought from the 1933 Chicago World’s Fair    to gussy up the hardpan. What penetrates, what softens  these calcic horizons, though, is nothing. When I imagine  a future here, it pools on the surface, silty tonic    I fuse my lips against. My eyes plunge in the peacock’s crest, attempt  to decipher the blue. It’s not pigment, but structural, a matter of light  interference and angle. I feel myself scattered this way,    and when a woman emerges from the library’s double  doors with her brood, I’m immersed in the story of her  miscarriage, she’s pregnant, pulling a wagon full of speakers    and amps through a rare rain, the field empty now, and she  scouring the Bermuda grass for her lost keys . . . it seems natural for her to blurt  this pain to a stranger. I can’t fully attend, nor can she,    the peacocks being larger than some of our children, our children  angling to pluck such color, and that’s what makes the sharing  easy, like two swimmers’ limbs grazing under water. I forget    this reserve of sweetness in me, past all the barely soothed  seething, clutch of versions I can’t un-nest, harem changing  in the makeshift fitting room at the center of spread    fan-tails. Like any mother grows eyes  in the back of her head, hears danger tucked  in the quiet, knows whole people can burst through.   Down by the bay  Where the watermelons grow,  Back to my home,  I dare not go. . .  Traditional    I purse my lips and spit black  seeds, drum the water  melons till their hearts beat  back. Mosquitos vex me none,  I’m easy in my blood and thick-  skinned. I linger saltily, dusk-bound  and free from wagging fingers  and the circles she’d ring round me  if I returned. The fancies she wants  to plant in my head, well,  I grow my own. I’ve stared at the sun  all day because she told me not to,  and now I can’t go home. Or I’m holding  my little hands up to my eyes  and she’s pretending not to see me. I was just a kid, didn’t know  how far I couldn’t go  hunting skin against skin    a legacy of hunger.  I was just a kid. I’d  started bleeding at 10    then learned to wear wit  like a burqa but still I burned.  I yearned for some relief from    wild animals that roamed my skin  at night, leaving shocky fingerprints  between my legs, hunger    warm and ripe in my mouth. Once  a boy said, “Let me put it in just a little bit”  as our parents slept in the next room.    By then I’d already sat bare-assed  a dance tutu over my vagina  as other girls reached thrusting hands.    No one there to tame us we were  children of skin and want. We could  bewitch the innocent with    our terrible, hungry hands  suck them whole into our mouths,  as we played, drunk on desire.   shoeless shanghaied riding the twilight  vehicle jerking beneath me  like a roller coaster on the upslope    what will we do if we see one?  the word ‘suddenly’ comes to mind  like in a mystery novel a real page-turner    I scan the circumference of the water  hazard—16 th hole—then I’m past it  gliding among the prefab houses    palm trees like serifs added to their yards  my stepmother almost seventy  still maneuvers like a hummingbird    she shows me one of the lakes &  another pond a dock a cul-de-sac of reeds  we never locate anything with teeth    before darkness drags us home  “don’t give up” she says “they’re here &  time to time they come to look for us”  Were you beautiful—yes.  Were you alive—yes,  despite that traitorous spine  and the foot—  that damned pata —  broken  ulcerous  gangrenous—  then gone. Briefly survived.    I think about Frida’s foot  and the steps it took over floors  and roads and rock.  The dragging out of an endless injury,  the dances it watched,  the red boots that usurped it.  I think about Frida’s foot dragging    as a ball and chain,  a lump of uncooperative flesh and think  What do I know of pain?    Nothing  but what I know of Frida’s blood,  her blackened toes,  her feet and  wings. Girl Jamie walked into the church straight and tall  like her brother when someone was inspecting one of his welds.    She pushed through the soft perfumed bodies and towers of done hair  to sit beside her mother in the heat and yellow light filtered through stained glass.    Jesus prayed on a hillside, shepherds prayed at the baby Jesus,  a confused apostle lifted his hands at an empty tomb,    and when the preacher hollered “tell God you want a miracle,  tell God you need a miracle, feel God delivering you that miracle,”    the woman on Girl Jamie’s other side grabbed her hand.  Girl Jamie felt the woman’s big rings pressed into her finger joints,    felt the plush pads of the woman’s palm and fingertips  so intimately on her own skin, and felt the shock of God    through her body. She looked around at the bowed heads  in every direction and their belief shattered her like lightning    in an old pine. Oh that feeling of holding back sobs  you are so embarrassed to sob.    The tears ran down her face, her arms, slicked the fingers of her praying neighbor,  the blue church carpet, and red upholstered pews.    The preacher said, “The saints have arrived. They come on this flood.”  And then he was swept down to the basement on her tide of tears.    The women setting out lunch for after the service gathered up fried chicken,  the casseroles, green beans, the macaroni, biscuits    and ran for the high ground of the cemetery.  When Girl Jamie stopped crying, only she and the woman next to her    remained in the sanctuary. They parted hands  and took different doors outside.    Girl Jamie’s mother waited for her beside the graveyard  and Girl Jamie had never felt so clean.      *These poems are part of a series that centers around “Bad Jamie” – a pill addict in southern Appalachia—his daughter Girl Jamie, and various other family members. As family folklore and environment intersect in these poems, dead grandmothers turn to woodpeckers, women inherit the ability to live as mountain lions, and Bad Jamie is a black hole the other characters try to resist falling into. Girl Jamie’s great grandmother was a tiny lady  with tiny cupboards in a tiny house  that leaned slightly down the hill  as if the valley had something to say    but was whispering it over and over  and the house was just on the cusp of hearing it.  Perhaps the murmuring of the creek  kept the story or gossip from being quite clear.    When she asked sweetly and opened her eyes  just a bit wider, Girl Jamie coaxed her great granny  into making chocolate pudding just for her  and then letting her eat it right straight from the cooking.    The warm cocoa taste was an angel in the mouth  and Girl Jamie couldn’t even cuss her daddy  for a day after eating it.  Great Granny spooned it warm    into tiny cut glass dishes and let a teaspoon  be already holding the first steamy bite.  Great Granny always narrowed her eyes  as she watched Girl Jamie swallow    and swallow again and ting the spoon  against the glass until there was no more pudding  but the brown shadow of a pudding that used to be.  When Girl Jamie went back to the porch    as she always did, Great Granny ran her finger  around the dish and licked it clean like a cat would.  She tasted the chocolate and the remnants  of youth. She opened her kitchen window    above the sink and went as a woodpecker  in a quick a loop around the house  before she came in to wash the pudding pot.  Girl Jamie narrowed her eyes at a black dropped feather.      *These poems are part of a series that centers around “Bad Jamie” – a pill addict in southern Appalachia—his daughter Girl Jamie, and various other family members.

A small brick house that could not be blown down,  not by wolves, by crooks, or hurricane fights.  Windows dark, curtains drawn.  In his cave of television reruns, dim smoke. She froze  when her toes edged the room’s pitch black, then bolted  up the stairs to her bedroom each night.    Her stepfather thought a child of his own blood  would be cleaner. No other child came. No matter.  He could teach her to dust, polish  floorboards by hand. She could be worthy,  but was not. Next lesson, bathroom in the basement.  Swabbing up stains from his dribbling pee.    Alone was best. To wade in the creek  up to her chest, water’s cold fingers.  Gentle current. Silently walking  on wet limestone. All sounds drained away against  the bright glint of rocks, clamoring cold.  A moment to float.    She peered into her face  holding a small compact of shadows. Cerulean,  like the most inescapable parts of the ocean.  When he came home, he said, “Stop  acting like the whore you are.” Her mother  handed her a washcloth, hid  the compact for another day.    She stepped into the kitchen, wanting  a glass of water. He stormed  down the hallway towards her.  Coal-colored body, blotted by light.  He was wearing only boxers, meat tenderizer in his hand.    The late summer leaves were cups  of sunlight, bellies of green. The world swelled  like an egg about to explode.  It hurt her eyes to see the young rabbit, color of seeds,  crouched on the hill. Ready to freeze,  hide, or beat the ground and run. Then the shotgun slam  of the farm house door. Blink, the rabbit was gone,  just a rustle and weave, clanging lilies-of-the-valley and weeds.  i could buy these reading cups: now worth between 3,000 and 5,000 francs. i’d go to galleries in algeria or tunisia, i’d have them removed from the cabinets in the museums, from beneath the dust, i’d make the transaction, they could belong to me then and there. i even thought of buying them with the money i would make from this poem. i even thought of including them in this poem, but as i progress, they become more distant, and who needs reading cups when there is a poem to be read. i mean, written. the cups once bought would lose value like most of life a diminishing return or rather, latent; ghost.       about #05661 refugee #05661 arrived at the island of Algiers when she was 12-years-old and lived during a time of great poverty in the southern united states of america where she contracted a rare autoimmune disease. this is when she turned to poetry for comfort. she became an established poet late in life, publishing two volumes of poetry after 55 years of working as a healer and medium, helping connect those who had been estranged from their family members in the great refugee crisis of 2016-2200. her work centered on ancestral memories, the energy that lives within objects and the psychic space between colony and place of origin. it is also worth noting that she never used her government name and instead chose to use the last five numbers of her refugee id card. based in a belief that life mimics language, she also refused to use the colonizers’ hierarchy of capital and lowercase letters, insisting that all letters be equal once stating, “in my mothertongue the letters are connected, the way the letters stand in this language is a way of disconnection i am not interested in.” They move secretly in  the permeable loam,    shame in every shuffling step  though they’ve caused no death,    only discovered it.  They fold the body over    with soil and litter, cross themselves,  and give the only rites they know.    Three days later,  the children emerge from the crypt. Another October licks the gutter. I run sidewalk streets. Leaves  collapsing, bleaching, dried. Their veins are maps  I see myself in. Thirteen & I’ve spent a lifetime outrunning  change – but what can I know or fear? Seasons tilt, leaves rattle.  Small things I miss. At home, my unraveled briefs: the small star of blood  unfurling in the toilet’s porcelain belly. My knee seeps,  scars pucker my arms like white lips – but they were like that  already. & I wanted to die already. What does it mean,  womanhood? A hallway, a door? Another dumb word  I’ll spend my life chasing. It came for my mother at eleven  when a girl framed her for theft, again at twenty-four  when she traveled an ocean to have me. She speaks  of fluorescent stains and the mat she slept on. Says immigration  is a series of rooms: how she ripped herself from a blood-pulse  womb – and what did she run from, & what did she miss?  Love, kin. Blood. A world shuts when you say it. But I bandage  the wound. For what is life if not a room to chase, & what is this blood  if not a smaller ocean to cross? We crouched below the stone ridge while our parents  snuck swills on the patio, our small shoes planted  against rocks, cresting a crescent strip of dirt. Our fingers    spread atop the vegetables, crowning magnolia  in the yard, evening Coke-black. We gleaned moonlight  off fingernails and other shiny things, bending knees    without breaking roots. You said there were carrots beneath  us and I wanted to see. I wanted to bend my fingers into earth  and watch them become orange root, guttered with knots.    I said we were watering carrots. You said we spat.  But we did not pull the carrots out or crane their heads  into the night’s cold ink. This is not that kind of story.    Two girls did not discover the meaning of beauty, their parents  laughing in the backdrop. We did not become close or stay  in touch. We just wanted to watch something grow. Three months before my birth,  my grandfathers stand beside each other  for a photograph: some city,  China. Center foreground, white  margin cutting their ankles,  date stamped on the right corner  in rose ink. My grandfathers: laoye  on the left in a button-down, the soft  goldfish gums of his smile.  Yeye’s hair still black, coat hanging  to his knees. Do you know  what this is before? Crescent tiles  like small whirlpools, soft falls  of leather shoes. There is a crowd  behind my grandfathers, and beyond, white  building supported by construction crane.  Pine branches arabesque like dancers.  And the crowd. Their backs all turned.  What do they look at, for? There  is a fountain in the photograph’s center  that spouts behind yeye’s head and falls  into cascades. The sky dismal  like a white blanket, red pagoda on a hill.  There are many red pagodas  in this world. Do you know  what this is before? Two years before  laoye dies of pancreas cancer, a decade  before yeye’s mind recedes. Three months  before my birth. My grandmothers  are in the past somewhere, out of sight,  but laolao wears a white wrap  around her head and smiles, the roses  on her sweater red like pagodas.  Maybe it’s just an arch.  They could be in a city, any city.  Do crowds swell here? Do vendors  stand here? It must be  early winter. How does water sound  in the crack of cold air? Once, I read  a plaque translation before a stone  fountain: Please keep off of The Grass!  But it was a fountain so of course  there was no grass. I listened to water  splatter against stone. What kind of city  in this photograph? I called the translation  imperfect. I said I wanted to meet them. I did  my best to lift the second of this photograph.  Something still fogs the viewing.  I said it was time. I said it was not time. In the body, behind the breast, that retromammary space, a small child digs milk-ducts. Prayer is the nipple as flower bud. Prayer is stomach full of feast. This body holds the uterus by invisible wire, wound like a cocoon, this space an altar. You can hear the lips move against the skin. The body stores memories in the suspended knee-cap, behind the shoulder blade, the crease of the neck as it enters the skull. These memories are tightrope walkers— one wrong move and balance becomes holy and empty all at once.             “Nothing,” my teen answers, when asked what he learned  at school today. Different from the nothing the pathology  report showed and still different than    when my wife is angry and says absolutely nothing  for three days. And if I take her hand she just looks at me,  lips locked. Which is not exactly like the high-schooler’s    response, though the if-you-could-be-dead-  for-a-while-I-wouldn’t-mind stare is similar.  The label on the box that says 100% Juice    Nothing Added means it’s healthier  because they left out the bad stuff they normally  pour in. The screeches from my daughter    on her phone, “Did you kiss him? Tell me!”  then hushes, “I won’t say a thing, I swear ,”  are nothing like the quiet voice she uses    when she confesses to her mother she let a girl  touch her there but she felt nothing, which she  hopes makes her a good girl. This is not the same    as when your parents call a third time from their dark  apartment and ask what’s new since three hours ago  and because you are a good son, you tell them,    again, the temperature, what you ate, the TV show  you’re planning to watch; and you are either afraid  to return the question, because no news is good news,    or you do ask and hear only the wheezes, coughs—  the nothing that leads to a cross country plane ticket.  Looking out the window on the red-eye, after a second drink,    you know there’s something out there. Forgetting  you finished the drink, your hand brings the plastic cup  to your mouth and somehow there is a little left, a sip. My dead grandparents from Poland,  Hungary, the shtetles , 9 days in the bowels  of a ship, are in my pool,    taking turns floating in the blue  and white plastic chair filled  with my breath.    Grandma Tillie, who shined shoes  outside the men’s room  at the Port Authority, lays back    in the postcard sun. Her faded rose-covered  housedress fluttering above her pale,  plucked chicken legs—    bathing in the sequined water; her  childish laughter mixing  with shy splashes. Then my father’s father,    whom I never met, his name my name.  A subway pole of a man in t-shirt  and brown slacks, smoking    a cigarette, mystified  by the tenement tall palm trees,  squinting to see if this is real, him    in a chair in a swimming pool  at his grandson’s house;  no taxi cab to drive    all night, no meters counting  away his life, no Jew-hating bosses,  no bolt of pain in his chest    stopping him at forty-six.  Just the breeze from a new ocean,  the gentle waves    of his own breath. I see myself  wading over to him, I’m holding  a glass of dark schnapps .    He kisses my wet head, sighs soft  and blue, “It’s too much,  Meyer, too much.” He rows himself    around me and around me.         It’s fall already and I feel petty—scared—trapped in a life squandered on too much television.    stacking firewood—  the watch’s hands  almost noon    It seems too late in the year for lady bugs to be hatching, I think, as their squirming, pulsating red blooms from the weeds, life billowing uncontrollably outwards. Tiny jewels beading the dry grasses, the mule’s ear and checker mallow, along the path beside the woods. And I haven’t had my period in months. One hand laying against my belly as I gather tinder. Then I feel it—too tight, low, heavy. Too something. I shift and my fingers come away wet from between my legs.    fingernails—  I imagine snow white  beneath    The emergency room. The white-noise hum of fluorescent lights. There’s a man pacing anxiously, an elderly couple seated in the corner, and a young mother with her daughter beside her—red lines running up her chubby, little girl leg. Stop scratching, says the mother. But the girl’s fingers are planted, roots against the crust, finding their balance. Here, take my hand, the mother finally says. The child holds tight. An oak tree growing from the decaying tree beneath.    the bobcat—a great hunter  or a dancer  when she grows up    I look at my own hands, already so old and wrinkled. Did they smoke? Or sit out in the sun? Did they laugh or frown too much? Or preserve themselves with drugs and alcohol into that Iggy Pop-Aerosmith-Rolling Stones look? Or did they just waste too much time in dish water? I spread my fingers and stretch my palm taut, turning my life line red like an artery.    pillow talk—  an apple pie cooling  on the still warm oven    Soon I’m swaddled in a pastel hospital gown made of the softest—strongest—cotton I’ve ever felt. Warm. Free. Drifting to sleep between the mechanical heartbeats… six months later. Again a hospital bed, my husband’s hand. I can do this, I think. She’s so tiny… and even though she’s squirming horribly at my touch, I know she needs me. And the truly great ones are never famous until after they’re dead anyway.    winter solstice—  a new mother  licking her kittens clean. Litany of Failed Lines from Previous Poems    It is raining. I am all nerves and sinew when we knock teeth. I forgive you for that time you found a 3-legged mouse and took it home to nurse, forgetting all about me at the bar until closing. The way you say my name: suZAWN: as if it exhausts you to think of me out loud. Let’s go swing around construction sites after dark, our bodies dangling from skeletons. Your mind bright in spasms. I want to break open that melon head and pick out the seeds. There was a time we slept on suitcases and photosynthesized in the sun. Your mouth left holes. Your mouth a lit cigarette. I used to think eating the seeds meant a watermelon would grow inside me. You’re full of useless baseball stats. The feeling of wet socks. But still. Explore the vacant lot of my mind. Feed me into the air, into the darkness. Read me like a box of cereal. No. Read me like the ad for free STD screenings on the side of your bus, which says  there’s no medicine for regret and ignorance is blisters. birth is my mother’s original sin.  mama the first country i left in a flurry of blood,  mother, the first country i called home.  the womb is not eden, or maybe it is:  a garden of dark and buried things.  in my dreams i am fat as an apple.  i squat in the field  behind my childhood home.  i give birth to a daughter  i name after myself.  in the morning there is blood  on my sheets, ink on a blank page. who will grant  me penance in my old age? daughter, forgive me  i say into the mirror. there is milk between my thighs.  like the women before me,  i only wanted to grow  a country in my womb.          I take as tenderness the soft curve  a red car makes to miss me,  my body half outside    the narrow shoulder  of what undid me once: Hover of late light, aquatint     on your bare back, unlined by the illogic  of bikini straps. My far-away look outran yours     past dunes and wood-stubble fences, to a tower of pines  where someone carved, into feathered bark,     a filthy name for the pinkest part of my flesh.  Silent in the back seat     we crossed the Sagamore. I wrapped my arms  around a cardboard box: Euclidean geometry     agape at moon and cockle shells,  the improbable perfections of dried wild roses.    Taillights hemorrhage at the bend,  the trees, up ahead, still inured  to unglisten. If we are young & our minds  have quelled within us  let us           rise  & if       we         have raised     our enemies    & worn  spirits whole by whole & if  we have stood & mended     our gloves  & stood again            let us rise,    If we have become numb      & if we  have opened the windows,  assembled our fingers with flowers,  let us rise    If we have spit the seeds & kissed  our tongues & removed our lips to the outside  of the blue concrete sky & peeled up our breath  young as clouds, rivers  let us rise    If we have kept our stories & washed dishes & yanked bedsheets  let us rise    & given our bodies to other bodies  let us rise    If we have excited & closed &  closed our mouths, let us           rise         & if  we have drowned in lakes            on the belly of a crow  & heard their fists  & blew candles  & felt the cactus thorn  & spit up fruit  let us rise. If we  have smelled sugar & our elbows have numbed the sky  let us rise    If we              have drawn our own hands let us rise  & when our hands have numbed the backs of other hands  let us rise    & if we are young and far from zig-zagged  & all our muscles have crawled outside us    & if we have pulled weeds & whispered  through the eyes of needles                                 let us rise    & if we have found our fathers  & called our sisters close        & talked story    & if we have heard the dust from trains  let us rise    & if we have been stilled  for that              & for this  & hummed the melodies    & obeyed             & if we have stayed  & stayed  & stayed  & stayed    let us rise. When I squeeze the rind of an orange  so that citrus vapors can flavor the air,  my grandfather is a tecolote  blooming pellets from his throat.  What other animal dreams this way?    My arms hold me there  —only this time  I am not pretending they belong  to a woman so in love  she would flatten herself  to get this close. This time  I am just holding onto skin.    When I conjure you  it is always the intersection  of water and spirits.    My grandfather watches a moth  tracing the orbit of fruit  around his head and we’re no longer  climbing trees. Sitting in the living  room. He is no longer  listening to me read  Viramontes tell of generations.    When he closes his eyes  he falls back into his seat,  holding the small wing of an insect,  a longer strand of women’s hair.  by her large round window near the San Gabriel  my unarmed mother falls off the wind  forced to fly, blushing and now  carried off by water without her tank of oxygen    as she inflates  she remains small    then the San Gabriel exhales  blood-vesseled  a river of lungs  that same Mexican folklore  has an anvil’s hold on me now    without Pacific Electric or Red Car  downtown ‘scrapers  the vein’s shores should bloom    without the remains of anything broken  that and us  our larger selves    from the large round window a cloudburst  patronas singing to the softening man  aboard the train to nowhere  norte, the pressure of tired muscles  they, a detritus  take from the San Gabriel  it takes from us. it is my fear that tears apart the place.  apart the strange, apart the fat rose  in its muddy bed. tears the cave in two.  a wild hare bleats until its neck bleeds.    apart the strange, apart the fat rose  unraveling its petals into glass. this:  a wild hare bleats until its neck bleeds.  a catastrophe that has already happened—    unraveling its petals into glass. this:  avoiding it. bringing it back and dissecting it,  the catastrophe that has already happened,  where I forget all the dead animals.    avoiding it. bringing it back and dissecting it—  it is my fear that tears apart the place,  where I forget all the dead animals  in their muddy beds. tearing the cave in two.                                        Mother worried about holes in the road,  afraid the bus would hit one  and the monkey in her hair  would wake on their way to Lima.    There, she studied economics  and wore pearl necklaces  Abuelita had made  under the only lamp in the house.    The monkey, Tito,  was a gift,  moved from his tree in the Amazon  into my mother’s curls  where Abuelita couldn’t see him.    Away from the Amazon,  Tito was asleep,  unable to tell my mother his dreams  of seeing everything from the tree tops  and howling back to his family.    When Abuelita found him,  she made Tito a bed under the lamp,  praying him peace as she inspected pearls.  He still died from the cold.    Away from her Amazon,  here, in the United States,  Mother is silenced by English,  far from Abuelita,  unable to howl back to me.    Still, I ask her to tell me about Lima,  Tito, and Abuelita  as we eat hot dogs and fries downtown,  hoping her own voice  wakes her.        Eliana Swerdlow is a senior in high school, who has participated in the Adroit Journal Summer Mentorship Program. Someone at the party said  Willie Nelson died today ,    sudden invocation of his sudden  ghost. And Maw-Maw singing on the road again  and Willie, who had outlived her,  rolling down eternal highway, baptized  by salt water and yellow beer.    Elastic hours later, we learned  it was a hoax and like a mosquito sipping  the same bite Aubrey asked So  is Willie alive? Is Willie  alive? Do we know if Willie is  alive? I might have answered  with hot oil. One day  I’ll slide mothballs  from my father’s dresser, inherit  my mother’s cast-iron but  until then—a dream like  lavender oil burning  on an unsteady shelf:  my sister listening beside me to bells  and banjos in the valley. We hold Holy  Ghost hands, exhume neglected records,  play them with new mosquito thirst.  And it’s like this           a shaky arm lets me steep too long           My past self, a pile of skin  cells settling in the dent of his shadow in every shot           If my oldest memory of you  involves a lake             how waterlogged does that make your body by now           If my head  is the cage,             which of us is the lion           The farther back, the eggier           the screaming   becomes in my ears           Could I be more obvious if I finger paint you  stick figured, inside of my cheeks             being chased by some large             (but no  less dead) mammal             In public I pick my teeth with the boniest             beliefs but you don’t   know the faces I make in the dark           the pop I play on repeat when no one’s  coming home Don’t make this awkward I’m still             a breath but I’ve lost my hand  pressing into the wet cement             of your heart longer than I should by a name             not mine        Then  the cold,             the crumpling, my stomach like an aluminum ball             and the radio    not rewired in time do you copy when I watch all my friends in my living room through some binoculars  backwards to feel Mars far away If my other arm was never there ,       is it still a phantom  limb if I can’t remember when it first showed up , can I really be bothered by your ghost. And all my friends pack together ash castles on the beach after  a bonfire           spit for mortar           and the ocean rolls back home           with a knot    in its stomach             to pick through the day’s personals           There is such a sunlight     A surgeon in a box  prepares a body for dissection           draws lines shapes colors    skin like stained glass           Next to me           in my pew  a fly genuflects and the echo           cathedral wide    deafens           only to be drowned by the organ’s groan             a distorted sound like  Wheel of Fortune’s Bankrupt spin               A kid with crossed legs    holding his crotch             hands me a basket and I’m hot in the face  with shame, my single dollar           All I want is the morning paper             My blood stuttering    in the sunlight         the sky so heady, thinking the world of itself         On my front porch,  one neighbor kid           triages the other neighbor kids    after a game of cops and robbers         I will walk back inside without the paper         without my arm  either         and my one good hand going inside           my pocket for an excuse         comes out addled. The Mom allows the eight-year-old boy to sit shotgun for the first  time. He watches red cars glint in the sun as they drive.    She tells him he needs to learn a shloka . She’s making him sing it at  Temple Sunday where the incense smoke soaks into his clothes.    The boy didn’t know sitting shotgun came with a price. Mom’s voice  distracts him from the woosh of shiny cars passing by, but he knows  better than to bargain with a voice that stills him.    Yaakundain Duthashaarahaara Davalaa, she sings & he repeats,  sullenly. He repeats as she corrects his duhs & dhuhs. Her voice soothes but he  remembers the lady in Apollo 13 humming her sweet song in the shower.    He is determined not to let beauty lull him into false security. That  mother’s voice could drift out of his reach at any moment. This is  why they teach detachment at Temple.    So he stays sullen as he repeats. Yaakundain Duthashaarahaara  Davalaa.    He feigns apathy. Saraswati Bhagava- She interrupts,    bhuh not buh. Herepeats. Saraswati Bhagavati.    He repeats, in his head, until the syllables that are not yet words loop,  until the sounds that are not yet symbols are recited automatically  when his Mom wakes him from the couch to go sleep upstairs.    The song— Yaaveena  Varadandamande Takaraa— When the other boys ask him where he goes on Sundays while they go to church, the boy talks about soccer practice.   He talks about how he sings at practice to tease another boy who chases him    how they run in circles as he sings I like to Moody, Moody. He doesn’t know the song actually says I like to move it, move it. He doesn’t know the other boy’s name is not Moody but Hamoudi     & he laughs every time Moody chases him.    The two boys do not know they are minorities yet because they are eight in the ambiguous suburbs      of an ambiguous state     where soccer takes a backseat to playing tag & plucking grass in soccer practice. The   other boys laugh & the boy sighs  relieved by the sight of his Mom’s minivan. He grabs his shin-guards from the garage as the other boys mount their bikes to ride to another ambiguous cul-de-sac in the neighborhood. His Mom opens the door & says Hi my betas to the boys as they pedal & wave. Her voice is a bell for the boy      who rushes in & swings the door closed before her voice has a chance to ring more. He watches his friends ride away     thankful they don’t look back. Shrapnel drifts like maple syrup    torpid  in a black pond    as Tom Hanks declares    a problem an eight-year-old boy in Ohio  cannot understand except for the image    of ship shards    floating in a vacuum      where the astronaut’s  wife’s wedding ring cannot echo     its clink & decrescendo    as it falls to the shower drain    where her sob  for her husband    suspended in a sphere of rent metal    cannot reach its intended ears    The boy slurps  his chai as he watches the screen in the kitchen    His shoulders sink for the astronaut’s wife     who the boy imagines  could be his Mom     who cannot reach     where her love tumbles    This is how space becomes more     than night sky blue  dappled through branches & skylights    more than a vessel for the moon  the stars     & the boy who eats pancakes under them    This is how space reminds the boy that he lives two places  at once      why later at karate class     anxiety sidekicks his ribs    renders him airless     when he cannot do the splits. Mom’s first word was the cannonball  she became. Shot out of moving cars.  Soon she’d chanted herself deaf. Picked up  ring toss, porcelain plates at our open mouths.    Sister was a natural, like some Roman gladiator.  On stage she was herself, and all acrobatic.  Clinical. Disinterested. Deserving of better pay.  Fed up with fire-breath and nets.    Descendant of an amnesiac of a juggler,  six scars on my skull mark my Father’s  missing hands. A Bozo bloodline.  Sideshow freak’s genes.    Four strangers and our sleight of palms.  Parlor games and card tricks. Kitchen filled  with featured players and four empty seats.  A bang, and some smoke, then us, out of sight.    The vanishing act isn’t always about hiding.  Sometimes you must make the crowd disappear. You can die in January if you want, and lots of people do, but this far north, nobody gets into the ground till spring. Harold waited last year as Anna waits now, as our ancestors waited back in Norway.    Memorial at 11:00AM. Remains to be interred at a later date.     I start to tell about the winter it hit forty below and they closed the school, so my friends and I walked a mile to the hill and spent the whole day sledding. But the end of every sentence scurries away into the corners of my mind. I track it down, step on its tail and pick it up, but too late, the talk has moved on.    My daughter still has the tiny dresses Anna made for her Barbie, slender sheath, elegant jacket, top doll fashion of 1965.    Pastor Carla says how hard it must have been, losing her husband, says it several times, but nothing about how hard it was finding him in the garage, car still running, after the bad planting of ’74. They sing “What a friend we have in Jesus.” “Christ Almighty what a pal!” I think, but do not sing.    The church ladies have honored their old friend with no mere ham-buns, but hotdish of both kinds, hamburger and tuna, and bars for dessert. My cell phone rings, and by the time I’ve figured which way is right side up, the call is gone. I get so goddam mad, sometimes.   As we head off to our own later dates past huddled cows and stubble fields, grain bins with conical Tin Man tops, the snow skirls dry and meager across the frozen road. 1: I dreamt of water. Swimming. Though not the way you’d think someone dreams of water. No, I couldn’t breathe in  it, I was not a mermaid. Though I imagine dying is a mermaid. All hues in all the rivers rupture, emerging death’s womb,  slipping, water-dressed.   2: The heart’s errata comes in waves, an iris, a knife sliding in the wrist. My roared and red pulse, its bleed renewing each  night. I want to see the spaces where you sleep. The way I might lurk in the black, tiptoeing around the other dead. Earthworms  on sidewalk after the heavy rain pulled them from the ground. Their 5 hearts all aching. Though I suppose I will never wake them.  The hearts. The dying. I dreamt of you, of taking your power.   3: I am howling. Casting spells. In the field, birds look for insects and fruit. They want something sweet, they want sugar.   4: A hundred yards away children handle a bullfrog. Pulling her from the thorax in which the heart  is situated. They want to make of it a home—the heart—and wonder what happens when kissing a bullfrog.  I tell them, he will only emit a stench.   5: There is no magic , the dead tell me.  Dreaming of tibias. Not broken. Of the ring finger. Not broken. Your radius, your heart’s ulna.          He is a dead verb. Was.      I used to say a prayer each night to God, hoping he would die because  what else does abuse ask of us? :   Looking for something to replace the grenades inside of him  :  Heroin addict. Dope sick.  When he learned parts of the Spincourt Forest are still so dangerous the French sealed them off, ground littered with unexploded shells & strewn with barbed wire and filled with arsenic:  his emotions : a rifle on the wall gone off.  Shells & iron buried in ground         :      He—made into ground. He—seed bearing organ.  Shells & gunpowder     :         The pistil the ground the seed holds life, or  the brown spoon or just his body.  I carried life for him juxtaposed his dead  :               my landscape collecting all of these bodies.  Caused by men, their made-up wars    :      Caused by heart war. Unexploded shells           :             His artilleries bleeding me white.  Ground filled with barbed wire and arsenic    :       I suffered the threat of ripened shells. Farmers are still turning them over. Over .     :      To the white mares who listen, shell-shocked.                        : Shell-shocked .  In a ground dotted with bodies      of nothing but dead bodies, with more to say. We insist on living… But some of us don’t. You never wanted to live. And now your body is held together by black swans lacing in and out of the ‘V’ knifed from your shoulders to your ribcage. In the suture grief is wild, where grief is genetic code, the links pulling us back into a family where we tether copper over your eyes the way you roped yourself with addiction. I have always paid penances for you. Even now I am rewriting this story. What stares back from the copper? Our boy crying. Your mother’s heart limping in single syllables. A line splits your body into thirds. Our son wants to know where your body will go. We have swabbed his mouth showing him you are in him. He is the boat in your sutures. We cry each night into the likeness of a boat. Its animals clawing. They asked where to scatter your ashes. It’s too much another prison to keep you in a box. The biodegradable urn will make you into a birch tree, or an American ash. Life will come back to us. Wild rabbits and goats. Your mother’s horses. But for now your body is plated on a silver table your silver lithium where I have asked for the last of your remains— your DNA. Your trunk where the ribcage will lift off like a gruesome lid. They have sewn your body, dipped into your soup with surgical ladles. Your lungs like loons severely injured. You always planned to die. I could smell it coming like I can smell rain moving across the field across the horse-apples, the geese flying their formation.          Pantera, little king. Danzig’s Lucifuge, Black Sabbath or Alice  in Chains, something with bite marks  and metal on the wrist. Because you were thrash. Because you  were a bastard. Because you were brick  to window, window to the undone  glass along the pavement, a surprise in the soft way  you said sorry .      Wilco for Chicago, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, temple  hymnal for the Sabbath you swapped  the juice for wine and went red as a Testament robe.  Something Rome for a city  you never went to, something requiem  because your parents died before you.      Lou Reed, little prince, Patricia Lee, Iggy Pop’s Passenger you were too young  to know. Dodos for the sixth song’s solo alone: the string sounds,  the shout, the jungle drums coming back in: like flight, Michael,  like light to the lakeside sky we were drunk, shrug, dumb enough to leap beneath  from cliff-ledge to black glass dawn-flat water. Our splay  to white knife falling to that blackness. Phoenix  because you are ash.      Wavves, Sun Kil, The Walkmen’s sun-washed Lisbon , because  you would forgive, Michael, these words, my sentimental and all-  night drinking among friends who remember you, better, loved you  with a rage like blindness, the sun against an eye.  Because I still don’t know  if you meant to leave us.    Something commissioned, little king. Something Philly, finally,  as that’s how I remember you best: still with your kid-fat, your little-  league tee, our hands together on the spool: November  and letting it out, the kite’s pale rise, the crows flying by us: how you just  took over, walked off, left me at the park edge, followed that white stitch deep  into the field. Michael, you’re dead five years  and I still don’t know what to do with my hands. If I said red-  handled jack-  knife blade.    If I played for you  a grainy recording  of a switcher’s whistle  moaning  in the distance.  If I pointed    to the Post Road, the woods beyond it,  Brockton, November  eating all  the light,  would you remember?    We are kneeling  in the leaves, Jacob.  I am muddying my knees  beside you.  We are seventeen.  Your mother’s death  between us  like a stone.    *  I am muddying my knees  beside you—  I am watching you work    the knife beneath the scruff  of the bark,  and I am still  in love: your corded  forearms swollen  in the cold,  drained hands  peeling clean the branch—    the grey    of the blade, Jacob, the sky  and the wind, the slip  that opened up an inch of skin  like a butterfly  in the thick  of your palm—    black blood  pooling  to your wrist, the knife just  dropped, forgotten  where it landed.    *  Twenty-eight years  and what have I given you?  A knee to the eye.  A spit inside your grin.  A throat-hold  on a schoolyard court,  our knees gashed by asphalt.  So violence,  Jacob, but tenderness  too—fingers on the neck  of the other, stigmata  of a split  sclera, a whole boyhood  of putting stitches to each other  like time  -marks knifed  into a wall.    *  In my dreams  I see her. Whole generations  are gathering  on the front porch  for a picture. She is walking  through my childhood  lawn. She is walking past  the black fence,  unimpressed.  She is admonishing me  for the mud  still dripping  from my sneakers,  the dirt at my hemline,  my insufficient hands.  I’ve never told you.  And she is whole again.    *  We are fourteen.  We are learning geometry.  We are learning the words  to the Declaration, how to count in Latin.  We are reading On the Road  to each other like a bible,  naming the chambers  of a reptile heart, how the shapes  of flame can change  depending what they burn around.  How a cell shifts.  Toothpick bridges. A night sky  made from a trash bag  tent. Lying beside you  in the darkness.    *  I’m sorry. Electronic  pulse. Intercom echo  even in the stairwells. Twenty-seven steps.  The bar-handle  of the metal door. When I saw the knot  of tubes I thought  of a highway. Her chest swollen  like a sodden log  bobbing in the water.    *  The night you heard  I didn’t answer.  I never told you.  I didn’t know  what words to say.  I never told you.  How silence  slides through years.  I’ve never told you.  The little hole  that opens  when I speak.    *  Weight  on the balls of your feet.  Sneaker toe-box crushed    in your crouch, the inch of air  between your heels    and the forest floor—    tongue and laces,  Jacob, the sky    in the blade, the slip, the blade  in your hand, your breath    suddenly full of knuckles.    *  If you are running.  If you are clutching the torn  t-shirt tourniquet rigged  around your hand.  If I can fix it.  If I am slowing.  If I am turning back  to the forest, tracing  the snapped  branches back, stepping back  again into the beds  our footprints pressed  to the earth.  If I can find  the branches, their skin  peeled pale  as an eyelid. If the blade  is still beside them.  If I fold it back to its hold.  If I am standing in the dark.  If lay the blade back  in your hand,  if I place it— i.    Even after frost, that clutch of pokeweed leers  from a gutted bush as I walk by, fruit thick  as a boy’s jawbone on the waning vine.    I’d like to pulp them under the heels  of my hands, drip poison through the faults  lined in my palms. When my dad dropped  like a rotted apple and rolled to another town,  I stared all summer at those dark berries skeining  what used to be his toolshed.    I wanted to fall asleep with my tongue  the same purple as the veins  in Mama’s neck when she told him you will give me  your respect, and so will your ungrateful child.    I wanted to eat. I wanted to hurt.    ii.    My college roommate and I discuss how best to slip  our parents their meds. I tell her about crushing  lithium into Mama’s homemade applesauce, still pink  with peel. When I call her for the first time in a month,  she tells me she lost her job – no more pills, no more health  insurance – so I say I won’t be home for Christmas  this year. She’ll be happier without me.    She says your first word should have been  “abandon .”    iii.    In middle school, I ink lists of black-eyed things  on the hinge of my right wrist: peas and Susans,  a dead wren cleaved with maggots, the girl who sits  beside me in homeroom with her shuttered face  pale as Xanax, no makeup on the blue-black ring  my dad once called a shiner .    One day, I touch her wrist and whisper, you’re lucky.  At least they’re leaving you something that’ll heal,  a hurt you can prove if you have to.  Forgive me, black-eyed girl.  I thought I was telling the truth.    iv.    The first time I meet my girlfriend, it’s past midnight.  She flattens my back to a door, teeth at my throat.    I say, let’s count the flares from the gas wells.  There’s a place where the groundwater burns.  Let’s find it. Let’s take a candle and a match.  She says, I love you like a field full of jasmine .    I don’t say, No one could love a girl like me.  My heart is a shipwreck of ice.  Every word I know rhymes with “abandon.” Spring comes late to Northern Pennsylvania, the heads of new trout lilies  bent with the last smattering of snow. Chickadees chatter in the crook  of a magnolia that won’t bloom for two more weeks, but still I return to it,  hoping the gray pods will have broken open overnight.    Like a spoon scraping the bottom of a tin bowl, Mama’s voice  scratches through the phone, saying transplant , saying 30% chance .  I strip off my mittens, heave myself into the tree.    I know what questions to ask, the language of cancer lodged  in my mouth like a rotted tooth, but instead I say  my visa came today, tell her about my unsmiling photo,  how the seal shimmers and reads étudiant .    I could stay , I tell Mama, because I have to—  because that’s what a good daughter does.  I say, I could give you my marrow and mean  I could give you my year in Toulouse. Take it.    Take the chocolate heart spun into the center of a tartine,  take the Basilique Saint-Sernin’s hourly racket of bells,  take the peacock feather from the Jardin des Plantes,  where roses reach full bloom by mid-February.    In the pause that follows, I wish there were leaves  for the wind to tremble through instead of just my scarf,  its tassels twirling as if for joy.    You’re not the right blood type , she tells me. Don’t stay.  I don’t know whether to say thank you or I’m sorry so I settle  for I love you , and she says she loves me too, says I’ll let you go now,    as if she hasn’t done that already. When I hang up the phone,  I break a pod soft as a caterpillar from the branch beside me and split it  with my thumbnail, bury my nose in the petals still tightly wrapped.  I want to smell spring, even if I have to kill something. i.    That night, a high wind whipped grit at our windows, drowned  the radio. When Daddy’s eyes rolled out of his sockets,  he caught one in the notched cup of his palm.    Mama chased the other through our battened shack, wrestled  it away from our thin-boned cat. These things happen:  twisters split the roots of our foundation, rust tatters  the edges of our spoons, the bell of every bowl is weighted  with dust. When she offered him his eye, smut-black and oozing,  he closed the other into her hand and said, cook ‘em.  Let’s eat real meat tonight.    ii.    The next day, Daddy woke with spiders nesting  where his eyes used to be. He cleared the cobwebs  with a swept thumb and sent me to melt down all Mama’s  thimbles. When they cooled to balls, he told me to paint them  blue, like he always wanted. They didn’t plug the holes  quite right, one false eye lolling like our back door, loosed  from half its hinges. Metal leaked into his blood.    Now, his tongue’s feathered with rust. He spits pennies  instead of tobacco. He and Mama don’t talk. All night,  we hear him scraping his teeth against the wet smile of his axe.    iii.    Daddy’s changed. Stripe rust thickens on the wheat  and his breath reddens even the dust. He still sees me  a little, but I don’t think he sees Mama anymore.    She fixes him lunches of screws and banjo strings.  He never thanks her. Once, I saw her juice a plum  into the bowl, rust shut his jaw. When I oiled it open,  he dropped all Mama’s needles down his throat and said  he’d spit them back at her, said he’d aim for the eyes.    When the next storm seethed through, she shoved him  into the rain and jimmied open his chest, found a cluster  of dynamite where his heart should be.  I watched from behind the kitchen door. She said,  I’ve had enough , and cut the bundle loose with her last  pair of sewing scissors. He took it out into the barn,  his heart in one hand, his axe in the other.    iv.    The day he left, Daddy twisted a nut  around each of my fingers. Now your hands  will shine . I think that once, they were pieces  of his heart. That night, I shrieked awake:  steel girdled my skin, all that shine swallowed up  in blood, metal rings notched snug under my knuckles.    When Mama came, it was too late  to cut them out, too late to do anything  but rock her hands over mine and teach me  how to bind my split-up fingers into fists. today there was sun. today, a boy. his skinny fingers— dunked, one by one, like bread loaves into the snow. today there was a love I had for popcorn, and legs. my mother’s calming throat. lozenge pills, fatty and strong. today somebody said die to somebody else and they did. today I bathed. today somebody said sharp and arcs through the wind, that is a fish-bone ; a woman said, that is me, too . today, my body tightened at the scalp and hair fell out of its black peninsula. today I swept the floor. today, temperature. swivel. brain. man in the public library with a kid to handle, another warm mouth. man exiting slow, like a lush rain. today I parked the car and steered the wheel all by myself, today I was proud. today, brain. well-oiled machine that speaks and rests. today she said, don’t let nobody call me no names and nobody did.    to live, to redden:  to praise small molars & feet.    today we fed. I drink coffee and learn it is  a laxative. toilet seats. ice cubes.  songs that remind me of you:  songs that don’t. the rain is  a silver tambourine over  my head. in every class I  teach I begin with a proverb.  birds, pots of gold. No man is  an island. I ask my Malaysian  students to define “glitter.”  they make a shaking motion  with their hands. in Japan,  I meet a white-haired woman who  tells me her name means Moon. “but  I am crescent now,” she says.  “soon I will disappear.” we wave  to each other on the subway.  the chairs are plastic  and blue. I forget my watch,  and the map winks with lines.  easy. the thousand ways I sit.  bound for Nasu, I watch  a mother swipe her child  on the cheek. in me: muscle,  bone. my sister’s nose, my father’s  tongue. the way he says prawn.  the way I wash a well-oiled  platter. the way I kiss  another mouth. pears.  pearls. I bite. I bite.  somebody pours  water into the mug: perfect  downfall. wet, bluing  squiggles. forget  subways. forget  I called. when I ascend  the stairs I see a cat  near a stray mango tree, I  do not shy away. I say my own  name. plug my fist into  the jar of honey, electrify.  disappear, then come  home again. tomorrow  I’ll eat. and the years  will turn themselves over.  milk, spirals  of rain. what we  choose. worlds we  kiss. everything  we leave behind—  wrappers. shadows.  a mammal, howling beneath  the street-light. licking  her own ancient skin. I want you to know that when I pick flowers  from my garden I wish their petals were your face  or a bell or some medicine. I want some way  to multiply bloom without the rare shit  of a mouthless animal. I want you to know  that I have no garden but the one we make  with our bodies. I want you to know how  to name a flower: sexy, fourth knuckle,  taste bud. Know that I never visited  my grandfather when he was dying  because I dreamed of not dying  and didn’t want to trim the bushes  or bury the cat. Know that my grandfather  is fine now, that his body is something  we know how not to sell or spend,  that we were ready for anything,  and that the cat wasn’t dead  because he had three legs and one eye.  Know that he’s just sleeping, doesn’t eat  or sing anymore. Know that my body  is an instrument you play by opening  the mouth and holding it till the night falls in.  Know that my other grandfather is deaf  and doesn’t love me. That there was a day  he taught me to hunt rabbits with yo-yos.  Know that we didn’t eat or kill them,  but found a snake that was already dead  and slit down the middle. And know  that the snake was full of bone,  that the underbelly was white and blank  like a map I could fold and unfold  until I felt transfigured. No, it did not  contain a moon or a rose or a tube  of chap-stick. No, my mouth tastes nothing  like that. And yes, I am soiled in light and thorn,  rendered an artifact which my grandchildren  would look at to learn how to kiss. POLICE OFFICER CONVICTED OF KILLING GAY LOVER  —CNN, MAY 2005.      : Verb, to be sawtoothed. For three jagged trenches  to be the throat’s lasting legacy. To let morning     enter the body like a man’s appendage; come  dawn, an encore—sweet voyeur, the blushing    sky. To let the nameless cop enter  the apartment. And Jesse. And Jesse. To speak    without words to the man who has not a name  but a body. To whisper hello until the moon drops    back into the barrel of blue hills. To leave  even trenches raked in the throat, to be    Columbia, Missouri’s worst case  in years . To be a body the rain    can’t take back into its mouth, a queer boy  the sky can’t erase.      — for Jesse Valencia (1981-2004)  There is still time  to grow Momma’s high-  throated laugh, her prickly    skin as if to say the world  may not touch me   here and here and here,    I do not understand  I have been made to grow  into a tree with color—    pink blossoms shrinking  only once I confess how  I let November touch me—    until I’ve already done so. Then  again, are a few colorful months  all I have to offer? I didn’t    spot the telltale signs of sin  until they were already snaking  up my back. There is no color,    I’ve realized, I cannot capture  for my own pleasure, no quiet  man I cannot be. I am truthfully    barren until I ask to be filled:  with night, if you please—   and June, and night, with a pinch    of dark . Then I am so skintight  or would the correct word  be skinfree ? Because I am standing    behind part of my body  and the night-wind gallops  and laughs and gallops away    with the rest. So dark, I doubt  there will ever come another  morning, and it doesn’t come    until I’ve already given  all my trust to the trees, though   really, every body is the same,    so what is there to protect ? Even when  there is more to my life  than a postcard of its season—    there is only a flash  followed by the faithless  dark. The sky goes    limp, the night a dress  to be worn. Across my face  a single lightning rod remains. She says it’s for bus fare home. Not like crazy,  paint the town, but mad mad really mad,  hornets and hell and how could he    And the fog was so thick they had to stop  and sleep in the car.

And the whirring heart     of the probe, the lens’s  jerky head, the voices of the team  sprung giddy from their job’s  entombment (“He’s trying  to figure us out”). Melville knew    the dragging and stabbing ( the monster  horribly wallowed in his blood ), the long warp  of the carcass flattened  and leaking, lashed,  ship listing over its haul. He never saw     the whale entire, eye-level,  unchased ( undashed pride  of hull and spars ) like this,    in the camera, whole  and curious,  the great breath held more  than an hour, and up there,  no captain with iron tip  ( out of the nail-stubs  from horseshoes ) waiting  for the spout,  the sound. I love the flatness  of it. The space  it takes in my mouth.  I like to gnaw on it  when I’m nervous.  It tastes like dirty pearls.  If kept in water  it becomes winged  but it can never be a bird  because it has shame.  I ask it about circular things:  moon cycles and foot heels,  how cats sleep,  the growing affinity  for arched windows.  It does not answer me  not because it does not  like me, instead I think  it has a problem  with being too precise.  I like to watch it  in the mornings  when its prickly hair  makes small grass shadows  distorted on the wave  of my drapes. Who knows  how it got to be that way.  Something tells me it happened  in a desert or another place  where air can smother.  It has the best skin.  I am jealous  I am so jealous of its color:  gutter milk that rises  onto the street after a storm  with one long pink streak  down its side.  I rub against it  to make a door  of one of us.  My father wakes  the machines at 4 am  while drinking his coffee  heavy cream 4 sugars  He is going to die one day  Today he is making a blue  to be used in eye shadow  It’s not the same  kind of blue plastered on police cars  or the kind set in rhinestones  It all depends on the temperature  He takes his time  checking the machines  Today each drying belt  needs to be at 900 degrees  for 8 hours to get this shade  to reach its full potential  It’s important to be precise  my father says  The machines reach 455 degrees  He sweats alone through  his denim pants, a different kind  of blue made in Vietnam  He wipes his forehead  work sweat is like beach sweat  it is all evenly distributed  like a good coat of paint  When they are ready  the machines hiss at him  the alarm sounds and my father  enters the code on the keypad  It takes one man to make a good coat of paint  In eight hours slabs of blue will process  down the belt presenting themselves—  not like children at graduation  or baseball players after a big game  but as blades of grass  resurrected after a long  winter in upstate New York  where the snow is deadly  and the furnaces beat themselves  into exhaustion howling steam through blue rooms—  not mountain blue not hospital blanket blue  but the deep midnight blue  at the center of my father’s knuckles  that one Fourth of July he set his hand  on fire with a set of Pennsylvania shooters  I pressed the ice over his fingers  while he finished his beer and listed  the types of apples grown in our county. There are shoelaces without any shoes hanging from the telephone line outside my apartment while Judy pours another glass of wine. The laces are red and the wine is white. Nesto is ordering Chinese food on the phone and I ask for just an egg drop soup. The thought of lunch makes me feel vulnerable. Jay invites two girls from across the hall to join us even though Nesto does not care for them. He promises to be polite. Downstairs on the stoop Frankie and Vinny and José share a joint and talk about Tito Puente’s last live concert at Lincoln Center. Nothing has really changed since then. On the T.V. the newscaster is talking about the protest. My boyfriend turns it off, he says there are too many bodies. Frankie and Vinny and José smoke it to the end and talk about Tito Puente’s last live concert, which was actually in Puerto Rico. Nothing has been the same since then. Jay’s girls show up both wearing brown shoes. Being polite is brown. I get out ceramic plates while Judy pays the delivery boy. She smiles at him because she’s lonely. I let the soup trail down my throat its warmth running down me slow like a braid. I get used to this pace. Nesto strums a spoon on the edge of his dish. The music sounds nothing like guns. as I know    all mothers must, this pain  becomes an even-handed story    told over gin, yolk,    and crushed rose,  wild abandonment—Sara, may I call you that?    you weren’t mindless.    We’re both  those    wild    flowers in Yeonggwang—it’s the part of the country    our people can’t find  because    cherry blossoms  are everywhere.    But I grow easily.           In Korean, 바람 relates to “wind” and “affair”  so don’t feed your husband chicken wings    or give a lover shoes. I’ve been mispronouncing gobbledygook  & wondering about Korean fried chicken    as well as old delicacies—chicken stewed in dates and ginseng.  I flew to America with Hodori, the 1988 Seoul Olympics mascot,    and narrow boat shoes. I cried the entire flight.    바람 wind + 피다 to smoke =바람피다 to cheat  my birth-father ran home so fast, the wind burned. Devouring  the dreams of    poor girls in  Korea,    this is my  wilderness.    With my  father,    I seldom  think of    hairpins or  September’s    red lilies,  only of white    buns in  steamer    baskets,  chicken    feet, egg  tarts, and    endless  pots of    scented tea. In church  we said Satan, get thee behind  and I always laughed. A demon child  with a twisted mouth,  at supper time I refused meat  to suck on bones. In the alley  behind the house what grew besides  berries I was told not to touch? I licked  the blood at the root. A bitter crop,  I came screaming—never tell me  to be quiet again. I know what life  the wind sucks, but what hits harder  than a hungry hand scorn by  a gallant South? I want it to try me.  Trust me, you’ve never felt a mouth  this sweet. This thorny. They said,  Somebody put sugar in his tank,  I thought myself an army.  Commander, when I tell you to  fuck me, I don’t mean  for your tree to drop in a spirit-filled  chamber of burning flesh.  I mean grow a thicker root. I mean  to say: crow, pluck me. Too much  sweetness can kill you and this  plantation can never be too used.  In the end I will have you  hung up, trapped in my Southern breeze. The body is a made up thing  so my parents claim to have a hold  on my life—that which they gave  can be taken away should I  make a fool out of you or me.  My mother can have my neck  but she chooses that of a turkey.  This she stews tenderly but the flesh  still hangs to the bone, hiding  tight in the grasp and groove of that  complexity. Someone broke  that neck, bent it into a delicacy  for common folk. We feast.  My mother chooses a thick gravy  to smother that which she loves  but does not tear it apart completely.  When my father says son  it is an act of possession, a reminder  of who’s flesh and bone I am made.  This isn’t that complex: I know  what a child’s place is and simmer  between utterance and defiance,  cradling the hard body of my soft  throat. Their mouths clean  meat from bone through teeth  and tongue—a sucking I hear  in the next room as a warning call.  Then the sound of dry, white bones  dropping into plates I am called to clean.  I like to think of care this way:  a metal spoon ready to strike at will,  to act as a knife, or to fill a bowl  with a love this thick. Inside the cock pit, men wear baggy ankled pants,  double hemmed, that drag up dirt like dying smoke plumes.  Sometimes the ground is already bright and blood-splattered.  It is always too hot.  Pesos are wagered on the flail of wings and  quickness of feet fettered by metal spurs; wagered on the  congenital male aggression of the species.  But, o, how tender  the gallero puffs air from his mouth onto the gamecock’s  head, under the gamecock’s wing, as if willing it back to life  in a kiss.  He’ll attempt to prop the animal up, its beak limp  and desolate.  Like the fowl, contestants in the town’s beauty  pageant are all ruffle and strut under the plaza’s temporary  spotlights.  Somewhere behind the stage there is a fog machine.  Chuy used to paint the set’s background but since he was  disappeared by men with AK-47’s, el Pelón had to do the job.  Chuy’s eleven-year-old son, Piquín, took the call from the morgue  and gave a DNA sample when Nicanor the Undertaker’s yet  unidentified body turned up in Santo Tómas.  Piquín was seen  kicking in the rusted yellow door of the neighbor’s truck.  The day the men went searching, some came back with finger-  nails like dark crescent moons. At night, the banda played  Puño de Tierra , a final bet already rubbling in the ring. I was already gutted when you found me in full-  moon’s eve. I was already raw and lonely.    My face, a calavera: eye sockets and mandible,  cheek bones.  My teeth exposed to the wisdoms.    I’d been drinking blues from what I hoped would be  a bottomless night.  You approached with slackened ears,    sniffed with wetted nose.  You kept your canines  to yourself. I bore my bony fingers into pelt, hushed    and rough, and soothed the patches at your nape.  Your eyes slit-like then.  And that is what I remember    most: the obsidian in your gaze, sharper than a razor.  How you finished off the gutting like a cool stream of river.    How I began to flesh.  Shape-shifter,  I’ve yet to hear the low pitch of your howl.    We were on a street called Jacarandas but in the dead  of winter I’ve forgotten how to name blossoms. Orchids hang from the patio ceiling. When no one  is watching I will take one and put it in my pocket  as if I could own something of this place.  By morning, it will be dead. I’ll walk by a funeral  home with child-sized caskets, and cry.  The air will belong to firewood. Night will return  cold to my bones. I’ll be alebrije: half woman,  half moon.  On the feast of San Sebastián,  fireworks rise and fall, like us all.  The orchestras will be spark then ash.  Nothing here is tame. I am high and disoriented,  pulled by my entrails. I’ll dance mezcal blues.  His hand inside my thigh will be a hovering question:  How can we do this, and where?  However and wherever, it won’t be enough  for the way I want to swallow this country: whole.  Mornings of marrow and oolong oiled  mother-of-pearl from too much milk.  This is how we heal.    Fingers sugar-tacky, we eat the day  cloudless, watch mayflies thrust upwards  to a blue the hue of thirst.    Your lip, a crushed berry, spills  its wet cerise. You say Even this can be  inherited  Be strong. Azalea and baby’s-breath drop petals on the nightstand like fly’s eggs.  Through your bent nose, your voice a mosquito’s as you sing:  Man is ship, woman is harbor.  Day by day, I gaze towards the sea. But we are landlocked beasts. Mother, I too envy any selfish thing.  Nights of amniotic dark so thick I can barely see through. On our bed of loam and animal bone, you purple your mouth on mine. All I taste is bellflower, though the eyes confess it is blood. How does it feel to be the reason I fall? You spit at where I open, your Revelations dog-tag, a carved silver sun hung around an apple-seed throttle. Its words cast shadows on my breast: “These are the ones who have not been defiled with women… who follow the lamb wherever he goes”. But lord, our waters and flesh, the body’s benediction that swells and thrashes.    //A blue wind whips the aspen beyond the window. Command it to be silent//    Your hands, an ember on my throat, you say, You’re mine, you’re mine , a litany desperate as the labor of your hips. I know I’ll soon leave this place. Hungry for any halved thing, heaven opens its moon-milk jaw and swallows the claw of a penumbra whole. My Mother    I arrive and you, riled,  raise your right arm, rattle your wrist    like a favor, as last week’s Calla lilies  languish in the trash—funny, even when you    could speak, there were daily lamentations:  chronic insomnia, the wait for pills, for weeks    you suspected a large bird, maybe a heron, was snatching koi  from the courtyard pond.    Today it’s ten past five and I know  dinner ‘s late, but Look, I say—I’ve brought    a bouquet of Gerbers for your room—  (offering flowers is me asking forgiveness  for my perpetual impatience)    and from the chair that swallows you  you lean toward me as if I were light.    How your helplessnesses  make the vase    of your throat so beautiful, your body  never at rest, pale stalk in a susurrus    of wind.  I’m reminded of how you’re slowly  consuming yourself    and no matter what I do, or eat, your illness  coats my mouth    like a sap.  I watch the antagonistic  movements of your lips as you seek the straw    in an imagined root-beer float.  Do you want to tell me something    you’ll never say—is it I’m so hungry, is it Why   are you always raising your voice— I witness word    after word crawl up out of the dark of you,  teeter on your teeth to fall back down,    wings still wet and folded.   The tray arrives  and I place it between us,    lift the cover off the plate, reveal  tilapia, sweets, corn, peas,    tuck the corner of a paper towel  into the hollow of your neck,    but sometimes I can’t bear  to touch what’s left of you with my hands, so I focus    on lifting the weighted spoon,  its handle wide as your wrist,    your eyes brighten—oh, how you amuse me—  the way those prehensile lips curl around their whitened gums    as you take in the flesh,  baring teeth—perhaps in defense    of the plate—and before you’re done chewing  you look to me for the next    bite.  Soon even this pleasure will be stripped  from you, the day the peristaltic muscles    of your throat choose to stop  their wringing.    In the corner,  this week’s daisies are already starting to hang    their failed heads, soon  there’ll be no more oily flakes of white fish to smear    across your chin with my brutal thumb  wrapped in napkin,    no more of me  pouring the last of the melted vanilla ice cream    straight from the dish onto your tongue,  so now is as good a time as any    to tell you  how all of my life I’ve waited to love you like this. For two weeks we’ve scattered a thin layer of our memories over someone else’s. My ties rest their points on a boy’s cartoon comforter. Shedding spine, Dad’s battered guidebook flakes into the cracks of a couch molded by strange arms. Against the unknown family albums you’ve leaned fresh postcards: facsimile paintings from the Prado, a dizzying zoom-in on a pan of paella, the words “Madrid by Night” on a black background, captioning nothing.    I ask what you’ve been looking out at every sunset. “There,” you say: A mother feeds an adult son who can’t speak, a man smokes alone, carving windows for a vast dollhouse, a handsome woman under lamplight fills her plastic sack from the trash, turns to a sidewalk ginkgo and makes three signs of the cross. Shelf by shelf of light, the avenue opens its inscrutable cabinet of reasons to live, “like looking over,” you say, “into the next lane on the highway and remembering there’s a person”—a pair of hands— “driving every car. I forgot what that was like.” You say you’ve loved sitting at the sill, watching the people blink on.    I follow your hand to your wrist. Up your forearm, your shoulder, above your nose and across the brown room curving in your contact lenses I can barely see the backlit silhouette of a girl scrubbing her father’s East-Side stoop, the murmur of her mother’s Spanish growing foreign, a first husband, the held note of a traffic-muffled violin and further in back inside outlines and outlines.           Need is not quite belief – Anne Sexton    – I know, but I want to believe the last leaves  of the season cradle-rock down  to me as I hear hands unclasp in the storm  coming. I want to believe I carry    the season of cradle-rocked breath like a cloak,  the one Juan Diego opened after  a storm of disbelief had him carry  Castilian roses from the hill.    My breath’s the one Juan Diego inhaled after  his cloak opened, and a door inside  the Spanish archbishop – Castilian roses  from his home country turned the key,    unexplainable roses inside the cloak –  and he, too, began to believe. Now I,  home in another country, turn pages and find  myself unable to make up my mind:    Did others begin to believe a native story,  the joke on the pale Spanish powers,  a brown-faced Mary come to make up their minds  for them, that maybe they didn’t know    everything – or was the joke on the natives,  the brown apparition on the cloak  a Spanish hoax, only the Spanish didn’t know  how far the joke would go: tattoos,    the dark apparition of the cloak mingled  with believer’s blood, on candles  with prayers, not jokes, painted like tattoos  on glass, Our Lady on t-shirts and charms,    her image bleeding through to believers, even  me, who wants to believe the last leaves  of Our Lady’s season drop to me like charms,  her hands unclasping through the storm. In Northern Ghana, she says, the Ga hold a naming ceremony  for every newborn, eight days after a mother gives birth at home.    It’s the first time the child sees the outside world, now limitless,  like an alligator emerging from a sewer, crawling out from the deep,    into the world, onto the street, its tail knocking down recycling bins,  awkward, like a curvy flyer with a small bladder in economy class,    or a student with ear buds giving a piggy-back ride to a stuffed  backpack in the ATM line; or a bro spreading on the subway;    the eyes weak, blind, adjusting to light, to whatever this world  is on the other side of the pipe. Adinto : a debut, an “Outdooring.”    The Ga say the week after a baby is born, it isn’t yet human;  it’s outside the body, yet it’s as if it’s inside — not a fetus, a non-    human thing, but a stranger, a visitor from beyond, a God  in the womb — and for a week, in the world. A foreign creature.    The passing through isn’t sudden, isn’t infant, isn’t death,  because the thing is an orphan without a name. It survives    in the sewer, in the deep indoors, empty in front of the beam  of the flashlight, beneath the world of the city — because birth    is like dying, expansive, the head in the shape of a balloon,  caught in a storm drain, circling, never having to exhale. It was still acceptable to wear  lipgloss with glitter when blowjobs  appeared in adolescent vocabulary,    but a white boy’s initials on my hand  was the closest I’d get to physical  contact. My friends saved me    posters of Jesse McCartney  from the stapled centerfolds  of Tiger Beat and J-14. At home,    Ma left glossy Scotch taped  corners on the bedroom wall.  White boys will never respect you .    Girls wanted poker straight hair  back when they fake asked-out  boys for their friends. I don’t    date Hindus . I tugged the red  thread on my wrist, washed off  initials before I went home.    I had no middle name. White girls  had monogrammed acronyms  on their backpacks: three letters,    like the “I Love S.O.S.” written  anonymously on a stall door.  It stood for Someone Special—    I wasn’t fooling anyone. I borrowed  shorts with CUTIE on the back,  but I still had two letters    to my name, knew Hindu girls  couldn’t have crushes. A.B. knew  to shut a barbed wire mouth    behind a lockless bedroom door.  Her grip on me tightened. It was still  acceptable to wear pink lipgloss    with glitter. The makeup bag  grabbed off the nightstand. I prayed  to Thakur for forgiveness, pressed    my forehead to elders’ feet. I was  chunks of blush from the compact,  crushed against the temple.  Most of the middle school girls I knew were mean because they had to be, because they had older brothers and their Catholic mothers refused to buy them bras even though they needed them, and they were embarrassed by their grandparents who lived there, too. They were mean because their fathers favored their brothers, or else their stepfathers snuck obvious peeks at their friends changing into pajamas during sleepovers. Most of the middle school girls I knew had mothers who worked as bartenders, or waitresses, or third shift at the Tyson factory, where they spent their nights inspecting an endless conveyor of chicken thighs, pale as ghosts. At lunch, they ate thin sandwiches on white bread. Most of the middle school girls I knew spent hours watching, in houses where the television was an extra sibling to attend to, where you got up to turn down the volume for dinner. We watched the middle school boys practice violence and sports, watched the neighborhood children for less than minimum wage, watched everyone to see who was looking, and when, and why. Most of the middle school girls I knew lied about their periods, insisting they’d got theirs, or else filching tampons and telling no-one. They were tough– they’d been drunk and in fights– they wore their hair pulled back tight so nobody could pull it, shoplifted candy and lip gloss from the dollar store, shared deep and knowing stares of hatred with security guards. We each took turns with the stolen gloss’s syrupy wand in the very back seat of the school bus before kissing the same boy, confident and blonde as a lion. His goal was to rank us. Most of the middle school girls I knew skipped their homework, but I did mine, little suck-up, and when my teacher still didn’t like me, I cried. But most of the middle school boys I knew copied mine– it was how I got popular– so I practiced my petty defiance and shared cigarettes pilfered from the littered purses of the mothers of most of the middle school girls I knew, who smoked Camels or Newports at night at the kitchen table or on the back porch, when us girls slunk home to find a worried mother waiting, one flannel-clad arm folded into the crook of the other, bags under her eyes and thick ankles, pondering which checks to float that month, her cigarette cherry glowing beacon-red with each inhalation of the inky, buzzing night. tempest \ˈtem-pəst\ n.    a  season,       rush,    furious   drum,    sometimes used  as   love        bird \ˈbərd\ n., v.    a fowl;             a flying.    among    men, a game.

Gaunt, beneath pounds of material,  in a corner so dark I only knew  she was there when headlights passed  and her eyes flashed silver.  Cat eye, moon fog in darkness, and the  smell of manure worked into the seams  of everything. She rose and dragged the lame  left leg behind her and showed me the vacant  stall where the extraction pumps hung  metallic and finished, still as a surgeon’s tools  or execution wires. The wind whipped itself  against the siding of the barn, and she told me  there was no place to bury her. The Swiss clip  of her voice was as hard and unopenable  as the frozen ground; and then she took me  to the cellar, and I saw the rows of beans  and peaches, her botched fruits, magnified  in utero.         Those were years I told one man after another sure ,  I’d fuck a lug like you, why not.  I looked down the barrel    of each rifled gaze because I wanted less to be like a woman  who waits than a man who takes as he pleases, enters a bar,    surveys the perennial variety, chooses which one he’ll take  home.  No longing; no loneliness allowed: just action.    I screwed inside the frame of a deflated waterbed like a ship-  wrecked coffin.  In a forest near Fowl Bay where bent over    a felled oak I heard termites gnaw marrow as a Meditator  quoted Thich Nhat Hanh holding my ass from behind.    One so short I leaned wheelbarrow-low and threw out  my back.  A full beard at a pit stop in Manitoba who cited    his trophies and bowling techniques before the white walls  dotted with red tulips bounced to the drunk beat of our bang,    one plush stomach against another. I will never apologize  for lust, I said, to men who asked.  To me sex was less sacred    than ponderous, from the verb ponder , meaning to weigh  and, distantly, egg .  In time each shag scored was less    a victory over gender than a weird, fragile exchange  in which I was given an egg to hold, or so I imagined,    as if to warm another vulnerability inside mine without  breaking.  One yowled he’d never touched a woman,    only men, and when I whispered I didn’t care, he fainted.  I told the firefighter who cried in my arms ecstasy is not    the end; it’s when we go beyond and, for a second, are not  ourselves.  He said, sorry, that sex without love was, to him,    the wet burnt smell of a forest days after its been doused.  But what if it isn’t about love after all; what if sex for me    then was a way to give shape to the untailored cloth  of crude truths I witnessed as a kid in a father and others    after?  I wasn’t always careful: I dragged outrage feet first  onto the sidewalk after he tried harm.  Even his egg has    a name.  There were gems, cock-kickers, mopes, punks.  There was fast talker, divorced and with kids who bellowed    Yeats’ “I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,”  when I told him the job was done.  Then a slew of brooders    like sapphire with their beautiful, busted faces, the lanky one  who sculpted what he called my ruined feet as we lay on    the floor of a rented storefront, leaves blowing through  a mail slot.  That was less raunch than letting night seduce    dawn, the warp and weft, woven skin feeling skin on hands  on skin.  Later, a poet who leaped over the bed like a flying    squirrel, citing Groucho Marks.  Somewhere sloped near  the end of my safari, I grew tired of my body’s hollow mess    when on a bus to Chicago I sat next to Eriks, a painter  who added an “s” to his name for pluralizing purposes.    I was going to an installation on taxidermy, animals  my long-distance lover stuffed and posed before TV sets    he left on static.  “Music emanates from the gaze of dead  beasts,” he fretted, “especially horses: because when eyes    can’t shut they don’t lie.”  But no one keeps eyes open  during orgasm, I argued, as we humped under a grizzly    he’d nailed to a wooden platform on wheels.  We rolled  around the studio, pumping toward our own little deaths,    when his way of looking at me started to make me feel  taxidermic. Eriks listened to the story, frowned, upset not    at the details but the 20 blocks I’d go alone to find this one  he guessed refused to meet me halfway.  When we arrived    in Chi-town, he invited me to share a bowl of warm soup  at Bumblebee Diner.  As we entered, the place glowed in    that legally blind way––outlaw yellow booths striped black  and white.  Eriks asked one question after another, as if    clearing cobwebs from the basement windows of my psyche,  then pointed to a mirage on my arm, an unfinished tattoo    by one who yelped giddy-up! cum time.  Eriks didn’t flinch  when I told him what I experienced as a child.  He set his    spoon down, and in the time it took our soup to go cold  he wrapped his hands around mine like a canoe and stared    into me.  It was hard to brace against his gaze, but the longer  he explored my face the more the fictions I worked so hard    to armor myself with were stripped.  There is no escape.  I am as you are, he said, his face turning into broad lowlands,    big sky view.  The world cleaved at Bumblebee, and I was  alive.  After he walked me where I’d meant to head, he touched    my cheek in a way that transformed me from the inside.  I could hover with you a really long time , he finished, then turned,    leaving me at the door of the one I’d come so far to sleep  with.  As he slipped away a cascade of smells and an electric    field of flowers appeared in my mind, a motley of bees  doing their fantastic dance, swarming aster to lavender,    golden rod, sunflower, helicopter-close to stamen, pistil,  and petal. Laden with as much pollen as she can hold,    the worker drones back to the hive, a smudge of truthiness  lost after so much sex with flowers.  On her return, chalky    and sweet flavors she swallowed swill into a cocktail she vomits  onto a waxy canvas.  She fans her heap dry with furious,    beaten wings till it’s a honeyed, edible shape, then goes on  for the sake of the hive, her life a solitary étude in touch. “According to Inuit culture in Greenland, a person possesses six or seven souls.  The souls take the form of tiny people scattered throughout the body.”  ––Annie Dillard    Small islands drift below I’ll never go there and Look the Norwegian  seated next to me on the plane says Swollen the moon he means is  full and alive as the snow below hazy as powdered sugar melts on my tongue    We are flying overseas I am a fireman the Norwegian says to me  flexing his biceps and Down there he adds She skis Greenland  his English so broken I am not sure if he dropped her there or wants    to forget her like the burning rooms he enters but his lips are opal  are full he takes my hand and pulls me toward the window we look out  and I am inside the night Michael and I ran through snow deep in    a forest where the moon set between branches made the night not black  but indigo I couldn’t keep pace the drifts locked my knees  but Michael was a gazelle so fast he leaped and reached the cabin first    still running looked back laughed his mouth open wide as ecstasy and  flew straight into a glass door that shattered  he turned into shards sliced into his body his face like a snow flake    glitters though one big shard shivered so deep into his bicep a round  blue muscle fell out steaming into the cup of his  hand so when I reached him the snow at his feet went red the world    went red shafts of light from inside the cabin lit the dog who watched  from the window as we looked at each other and said nothing  and Michael calmly put the living thing back into the slit of his arm    the way the sky calmly puts the sun inside itself each night the way  Michael who came out and was disowned by his family  calmly put himself back into death last week I heard he cut into his    wrists and was found alone in sheets soaked red a note said who am I  when I am not wearing my body but that night we ran  his insides spilled out of him and he was not afraid and in time I lost    touch or do I mean I never touched him I just left him like an island  there is no way to hold everyone together no way to put  a life back into the world once it leaves us afloat Michael I am finally    flying over Greenland but it is gone I mean it is not close enough to touch  I think as the Norwegian leans in his muscles safely contained  inside his skin and asks me knowing What is it you are so afraid of living “A wise woman puts a grain of sugar into everything she says to a man,  and takes a grain of salt with everything he says to her.”  –Helen Rowland    They showed me how to finger wild carrot blunts,  snip flowered kale leaves, tear the terse from sturdier  stems. The kitchens I knew were womanless; full    of men who cooked, silently, mouths riven enough  to sample sauce or graze. I snuck in, helped them  cut, trim, heft handfuls of severed greens into bowls    covered and ready to simmer.  Shaved frozen  butter into flour, a few splashes of water, careful  not to knead too much or you’ll kill it, then    rimmed wily sides of pans with flattened dough  stabbed by a fork so the apples could breathe  sugar.  I peeled and stripped knots of ginger,    gleaned scallions, sliced them into thin rings  stuck to each other.  Stout, bolder onions startled  tears that filmed and blurred everything I saw.    I guarded myself cutting meat, for how I sliced  through a thumb once.  There was the bled wound  a man mended with the same fat needle and thread    he used to stitch a turkey.  Nights were bottomless,  boiling pots of water; days: pans seared with oil,  peppers sautéed crimson.  Years honeyed into    turnip torment; the past a splash of vinegar  that worried beets from plum to sanguine,  potatoes yellowed into curry, anise clumps.    To cook with men was to learn how to season  the world into something we’d consume, and we  did.  Quickly.  I loved the exquisite, pinioned forms    of their hostile hands, scarred fingers that pinched  saffron, gripped iron skillets scorched with living.  I tasted everything.  There was one who handled    lit flames and fired garlic into chords of music I’d  never forget.  A mound of ripe tomatoes we stacked  into a tower leaning crimson, on the verge of falling. An alarm goes off each time  a woman thinks of sex, I read  in a supermarket tabloid.  Small alarm, early warning.    Coca Cola can be tried  as a contraceptive. Bottles  fizz open, sexual parts  douched till they’re sticky.    Then babies arrive  dressed in fuzzy onesies  snapped shut over crotches.  What a great kid, I say,    my arms full of groceries—  red-pepper hummus, blood  oranges. What does it mean,  exactly, thinking of sex?    Do Altoid candies enhance  the pleasures of oral sex?  Or should I buy chewing gum,  soft, sweet, pink, ample?    I stand in line to pay for  my beautiful lunch, dark flesh  of oranges, wintergreen mints,  big chunks of strawberry gum.       Poverty can be sweet, overripe  plums with the bird bites cut out  or donuts made from two-for-one    canned biscuit dough fried in grease  leftover from the Jerusalem artichokes  we plucked from earth like oversized pupae—    I can’t escape my roots because I ate them,  dirt crusted beets that bled  into our finger pads, slivers of carrots    harvested too soon, a bag of unmarked  white powder from the food bank  mom threw away when she couldn’t identify    ( We aren’t that poor yet )  and milk could mean a gallon, or boxed chalk  mixed into water.    Now I make guacamole from rotten avocados,  cover limp lettuce with dressing;  wine that turned and smells like raisins    can be used in a soup  and stale bread is perfect  for meatloaf or bread pudding.    That has mold , my husband says.  Cheese is mold , my mother would say.  We’d scrape it out with serrated blades,    the same I use to scrape the pink from my fingers  but blood rises where the stains used to be.  I suck it down. I don’t waste one drop. Apples are greater than ashes, but less than or equal to an empty music stand.    Couplets merit full points.    Reminder: Your peers will use this as a checklist, even if they have never yet written an elegy.    Ask: What is the atmosphere? Do birds sing when they shouldn’t?    Make sure the lines are a little prison for feeling, everyone in uniform, on a schedule, ready for lights out.    Never tell your grief, or use the word sorrow, or mourn.    Make sure every punctuation mark gives the impression of being kissed by a stubbled chin.    Be sure to include some form of the following: husk, pearls, something circular, something pried away.    As the honor code states: Any form of flower is grounds for immediate dismissal, as is looking over a dent in the earth and calling it grave. I live in a house that loves me.  —bell hooks    I drive through a forest at night. The trees offer their hands, like dancing partners. I want to say yes, but monogamy pulls me home. That shared solitude makes the bed with flannel grocery lists in the winter and in the summer, sheets that sail along lantern-lit coastlines. The moon tonight swears it’s never been to a party. With the pride of a hermit refusing post-Iron Age technology, the moon face-washes with the rags of tree leaves before going to bed. Outside the forest a village claims—and I believe—it too has never been to a party. Maybe someday someone will give the houses new dresses and play the fiddle for them. Looking for home in the somber basement of the day, I tell my pyjamas it won’t be long now. But so far away they can’t hear me. It was hot, and we had paper cuts all over our fingers in the shapes of the initials of everyone we’d ever known before the age of 18. Except they weren’t paper cuts they were glass slices and there were still little pieces in the grooves of my palms that I couldn’t pry out. And it wasn’t everyone’s initials, but everyone’s belly buttons and breasts, all scarred up and in hospital gowns after a whole row of surgeries. You said, drink the wine.  I said, yes please, and let some drip into my glass shards. Outside there was a grandfather toad who kept watch over us. He sprung up and down the unpaved drive and gulped nice oxygen through his toad skin, made sure no bad men made it to the house without squashing him and turning back in toad murder guilt. Everyone’s scars faded, even my own glass ones, and we felt good. You said it was a terrible thing to dream about dead end jobs, and I said it was more terrible to work them. I hardly believed myself, I still don’t believe myself. So instead you got two paper bags and two cans of beer, and you took me to an oak tree that didn’t look like an oak tree. It was split in half and growing back together, almost a graft, more like a glass wound. We ate peaches out of an oak tree. I don’t know how we made that trick happen, but we did. I told you about my deepest regrets: that I hadn’t kissed you first, that I’d taken the lazy job that fired me anyway, that I didn’t read anything for six months once. You told me how afraid you were of little pills, of my panic attacks, of your father, of being brave. It was almost night by then and it was all you could do to hold me like a silver spoon, so I let you. The air conditioner rattled, and I had bad dreams of all the bad things that had ever happened to me, and my glass cuts grew swollen in the humidity, and you purred while you slept, really. You purred like a tiger lamb. When it was dark I could hear cicadas, grandfather toad, and the turning of my wine stomach. I was afraid, but you felt so strong, you had no hair, you had eyelids big as the Arizona desert. So I let myself forget it all. The dreams where I finally jump out the window, the way I ruined my fingers, the time my dog died so my dad put a gun to his head. I breathed it all out and I breathed you up, and suddenly it was all roses. It was a moment to be alive – blood and bandages and all. I remembered why I was there in the first place. I remembered why you were there at all. I felt good, I felt bad too. You love misery,  you always joked. I love misery, I can’t help it. I’m miserable! I smiled, and you pulled my sweat and fat closer to you. Remember boy, the time I pushed you off the wingdam. Kissed you in the river weeds, fucked up on pints. Cue chalk between our teeth, you pulled on my armpit hair and I teased you for losing your glasses. You didn’t want to get in my way. So you let me alone, but I was always looking for you behind the after hours club. Or between the pines, where we licked whiskey by the train tracks like lost boys together – fat with sex and vice. Ain’t no one get it. Ain’t no one know what its like to feel your hard on in the warm creek and smack the smell of your good ideas off your thighs. I feel your clover tongue. The way you hock your spit on my ass. The way you tune me like a cracked banjo. The way that god is watching us swig, our faces like we are full of figs. Like your knuckles hit my teeth. The bad boys. How can we be so many fucking rivers? How can I have fallen in love with your belly button in a bathroom stall? Your shoulders on a pine covered marsh where you let me suck you off, as long as I checked you for ticks after.       That first summer we spent so many languid hours half-dressed on the lawn which spread between your mother’s house and the highway that we could’ve been the calendula growing around and under us, charmeuse-petaled, ochre-orange, spicy and sun-steeped.    But calendula don’t carry tobacco in their shirt pockets, roll thin cigarettes between gorgeously filthy fingers, drink back the nutty smoke. They don’t, at summer’s end, move to a milder city, slap a mattress on their new living room floor splintered by stained-glass light, admire the crown molding, fuck tantrically, or slip into the grey tedium of winter, of work, argue about mud clots on the carpet, the too-turquoise décor, laziness and neuroticism. They don’t press an apology between their tongues, dream up a parcel of land with a chicken coop, vegetable patch, citrus grove, two dogs and two kids; find that the bathwater’s gone cold. Wind-blown and mute they don’t fumble with the faucet—unable to agree on temperature— until milky water spills over the tub’s hard edges. Your lover is like:   crocus amidst snow on the boulevard  a cat spider on the other side of a white curtain  reading glasses, taped  the sound of a hammer swinging from a tool belt, its hickory handle loose     Kissing her is like:   koi breaking the pond’s meniscus  pilfering raspberries  patching a bicycle tire  cutting through a parsnip     Do her fingers feel like:   wet grass at the ankles, finally  dry rye tops brushing against your arms in the dark  an annual, say, vanilla-scented purple heliotrope  north wind in the ears     Does she taste like:   carrots licked with soil  a new word  twelve-hour Gravol  sealing an envelope, black as engine oil     Leaving is:   camellia blooms on the lawn, petals fringed with decay  a flat road framed by thirsty fields. For every thing you have missed,  you have gained something else  – Ralph Waldo Emerson      My lost sons are not a wound.  The doctor did not cut my womb,  he didn’t make me hold them.  Time has stitched the pain.    What is gained in so short a life?  One breath each: Such slight air  wouldn’t ripple a candle’s flame.    I didn’t want to know them as sons  but the county mailed birth records  to our home: Baby Boy A , Baby Boy B.    A year later in the same white room  where they died, my daughter’s  warm mouth found my breast.    Now she’s 24. Her self-portrait  in grays and peach and yellow  graces our bedroom wall. She awakens  the piano with Satie’s placid notes. My mother is spooning ice cubes into her orchid one spoonful at a time, like sugar onto a horse’s eely tongue.  My brother has a new job driving a glassware truck from Detroit to Toledo. He’s six-months clean.  The flutes and stems quake beyond the ten-barrel hull as if he is hauling livestock who shift their fragile weight.  My father is out back burning Japanese beetles off his grape vines with a crème brulee torch,  their thoraxes collecting in the pool-blue kiddie pool that he straddles like a butter churner.  I am arranging my clothes by color; off-white, off-white, dune, dune, cornflower.  So, I’ll be both dog and pony. Arrange my convoy of losses like this.  Get a running start.  Catch  a good wind, he said: Be a good    bird. I thought him German  as his hand did the wave––tumult    of syllables, the ocean. A gust carried us  from the top of a ridge to where land    helixes hug vague bodies  of water, pebbled pastures    skimming treelines across the range  littered with wildflowers. Winds lilted:    It’s not your day to go , as I watched  clouds blush vermillion, flying    in tandem as a crow does over  reservoirs and glacial gorges. That high    up, I thought maybe we could fall  in love, full of pomp and spectacle,    but he was a stranger, and to him, I was  strange; possibly ugly. Everyone    peddles timing ––the random alchemy  of abutting molecules––though    I’ve grown weary of waiting. Stillness  is the danger. So I spread out    my arms, carved ciphers into ether  while a choir could be heard along    the nave where winding trails scissor  the basin. Spiraling downward,    I mouthed a new prayer, knelt in air  for deliverance, morphing into needle    of a compass, unbeholden to a place  inhospitable: the mind. The mind bent    on forgetting: I was blown wide open.         She finally left—years in the making is the version  you tell as we sit in your apartment and drain    a bottle of Old Overholt Rye in the shadow  of foraged objects you collected like an old couple    antiquing: Pair of midcentury brass lamps, a salvaged  Eames chair, Fender and Gibson propped up    like prodigal children, mounted deer heads  from a taxidermy enthusiast you met on tour    somewhere in Idaho, a library of unread graphic  novels and vintage photographs striking that perfect    note of curated indifference while they scream  in their tiny frames: Are we not beautiful enough?    Your reserve elegizes her: foe granted  sainthood after nearly a decade of driving you    in circles—stunned by her gall to leave, forsaken  with relics gathering unwanted freckles of time,    you recall miles through vacant clubs and faces  of surly men buried in emptied glasses as if    those were the glory days when you thought yourself  brimming with promise—and lo, she haunts    the frets of our muted reunion. You rest your head  on my lap as I stroke your thinning hair, a scene    that must mimic the Pietà. A goddamn pity  party, really. I begin to shiver as I often do in dusty    cathedrals filled with exquisite, silent things—  things so entwined, you mistake wonder    for woe. You hum a ditty as I opine to no one  but my own whiskey reflection: Where on earth    have you been all these years? Bygones.  Nothing matters anymore. Your skin buckles    from my warm thumbs as I knead the back  of your neck like unleavened bread and gaze    over the length of your sighing limbs, watching  the rift expand between the oars. Multitudes,    I do not contain, for I certainly can’t sing  the blues, so I marvel instead at how the tenor    of your skin no longer soars, strumming  my fingers on your chest like an acoustic guitar    gifted a second life—to welcome  the quiet and perhaps another muse. Feet on dashboard, god-awful music blaring from mixed  cassette tapes, my father let me have my way as he played    chauffeur, never easing his grip on the wheel down straightaways.  Four hours to my college dorm across New Jersey and the Poconos,    up through Scranton to the gulch of Broome County in upstate  New York, not a word passed between us, mile after    mile markers on fence posts, yellow dashes, streaks of trees—  blurred liturgy of autumn, spring.  Summer into winter into    summer, ticking off hours that measured the distance as he drove  and I watched the road that held nothing but our widening gulf.    My father taught me willful reticence, folding desire  into cellular spaces.  Perhaps one day I will enter this dusty    warehouse filled with neglected boxes, find the one labeled  “For My Daughter” and unpack its long-held secrets.  For now, I let    him seal their seams with tape, stuff them into corners.  Recently  when I visited, he sat across the dinner table as Mom prepared    our holiday meal, both of them aging exponentially like radioactive  particles.  Wisp of his former self, barely recognizable, recited    the Lord’s Prayer: Our father in heaven, hallowed be your name.  Your kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.    They had just taken out his kidney: the half.  Life of failure.  Suddenly he opened his eyes, looked straight    into me and said, I know you, y ou have a frontier spirit. Where did he  even get that word: frontier.  We nodded in agreement, then ate    in silence like we always do, losing our nerve.  All I’ve ever wanted  him to say is: tell me something.  Tell me everything. The rain, which is inconsolable.    The day the morays go out to sea.    The lives of fish in February.    Carpenter bees who think it’s Spring.    Contempt with a side of sugar.    The swimming pool: when it opens, when the baby without a diaper—    Magnets.    When octopi throw shells (it’s true, they rage in the Bay).    When birds are premonitions.    Your perception of time.    The allure of claws retracting into the softest fur.    The kind of love that kills, that finds its pleasure in the stab, the kindling, the wrapped  heads of cabbages.    What held my attention yesterday.    What I find repellent.    My love for a shell.    When I’ll feel for you what you feel for me.    My cloak of invisibility.    Dry skin seeking rain.    The failure of cover crops, of a nightgown, on or off, to regulate heat.    A holding pattern. In the night last night upside down I woke to dream half dream had eaten steak before bed & a woke w/ a beef-induced nightmare.    Again I roamed the cellar, where once an ear grew on the back of a lab rat. This is true, I must explain, disconnected from thought, a human ear fully functional, I    mean there was no meaning was syncopating syllables or language awake in the breakdown of sound, but for stutter the halted staccato dictated I    must move faster, but couldn’t. This was not a metaphor for loneliness. See, I have trouble shedding lives &    was raised to be polite. My legs couldn’t run w/ the speed of rivers or feel the sides of mountains pulling as I stumbled. Sidewalk slabs couldn’t    demarcate my breath & its his breath I feel on my neck, baby hairs asleep on my legs oh the softness. When a prickled bed is not a place of rest: search hard under    this narrative: a viable six year old me w/my after school family, pawned house to house & after school gramps groans in his rocker: no I don’t want to sit on your lap. A girl couldn’t    be raised in a family of men, sky a darker tinge, think mama: where do you bury rage & what are you tired? You said, This is the world we live in. I    retreat to my room, build forts, was innocent in light reversed through Big Bird curtains & I felt safe again beneath spread cotton. I couldn’t make sense of the mirrored room of love, think    half feral, half divine, no lawn but tumultuous river of hanging vines, redundant flower seller poling left/right, my god, are these candles set in bowls or their reflections on water? Name the heavy machines men make to smooth things. I    forgot the trot is a pace not a dance. Couldn’t clog walkers slip on umbrella puddles? Even if the story leads to where the path crumbles, I think this means I am multitudinous I am luminous I    reach through volumes to touch child of sidewalk grime, am there somersault vaulting a metal pole meant as handrail, a knot I might untangle if I can trace where the beginning is, girl. The fire in the sink  moved in what Ma called buntog  a bubble body rolling its way  towards the drain  Today it’s red  Most days it’s green  or white / transparent  But I’m unclear about how it got there  This deep blush  like my brother at 15  un-wake-up-able from the smoke in his chest  We too often hoard shoes we don’t wear  We tease, wrestle  Rub together lungs for ruins  We burn our father right out of us. The Giant Oaks of Kew Gardens, Queens: if leafy, indicates sacrifice; if bare-limbed, indicates a refusal to look inward. To see through to. To throw shade.  The Mantis Religioso (The Preying Mantis): unusual; unnatural as a wire hanger, fast as a blade snapping back into a bone handle. Warms himself in the globe lamp hanging from the ceiling of the foyer in the Tudor apartments. Indicates the ease of vanquishment.  The Medusa: lying on the field of a cracked breastbone, gazing up at the insect; capable of suffocating Sicilian men once they have seen her beauty. Dangerous though beheaded. Indicates something will reach through half a century to you, but not moonlight nor light from the street lamp.  The Trinicria of Dancers’ Legs: bent at the knee, toes pointing east, indicating sunrise in hours, begs to be plated in gold. Indicates the three corners of Sicily, indicates an insert to fit a 45 single onto a hifi so the song won’t drag & warp, indicates caution: go around the other corner, go the other way, risk being cornered.  The Sheaves of Wheat: gold from the loamy fields by the mouth of hell and Etna; sprouting from the V of the dancers’ legs, where the blood should flow, but stopped. Indicates infertility, indicates the time she bound her breasts to look like the man that night she danced and danced.  The Queen of Mouths: thirteen mouths slit & steaming over her body, lavender essence wafting up to the mantis, and then gone, eyebrows like a crow that can find any heart in a field, kittenish hair shorn all spicy like desiccated basil, V at the nape indicating kiss me, kiss me there.  The Queen of Palms: entwined with Queen of Mouths, legs bent, cradling in blood and cum. Indicates friendship, indicates I hear you, I hear you over the B-side of a Mary Wells single: Boy, What Have You Done? Indicates a gentle death at last. Indicates a soft palm over a body of mouths, covering each mouth: I’m here, I heard you and I’m here. And another of my mother’s lies was the prize  dug from the heart of the artichoke.    And the heart of the artichoke was a dilated cervix.  And the dilated cervix was a single choke-fringed eye.    The eye was the stigma  of the plant protected by thorny leaves and the stamen.    I scraped the meaty pith  at the torn-off tips with my milk teeth to reach the heart.    She told me to dip the meat of the leaves in butter: warm, silken.  She said eat all the way to the inside: there was a prize in the heart of the artichoke.    But it was soft, the heart, and I imagined  a small plastic baby doll, tiny as my own girl thumb    lying unclothed  on the blue-green velvet heart. And the North Wind, with her trumpet and star strewn hair is their favorite. Then the pod of blue whales wrapped along the western shoreline. The little girl assures the bear, some day the parent people will come back. The bear does not care and thinks only of the ice floe and how cold seems like it would be silent, but he believes it’s more like static—a hum electric that occasionally cracks fantastic. Now the little girl is working on a double-decker bus, the red pieces like berries in her fingers. She can’t get the bus to fit back on the continent. The continent. Everything is coming apart, but this is only one way to look at it. The little girl likes the idea of burying the cardboard pieces in the yard so everything can return; un-colonized layers of paper and fabricated inks, washing back, year after year into the sediment, into the marrow of buried bones.       What I’d Wanted of Your Body wasn’t a sculpture come to life.  wolf in soapstone. whim of wild.  kettle where the ghost unwilts.    I wouldn’t build you, barrack;  on the sill sits shrapnel green.  I wouldn’t carve you, tremor;  here, my turnips rear  their spindly tongues.    what was left of the trumpet  once it stuttered the march?  oh, but only its mouth.    what went missing  from the wood, once an oak?  all but a sprig  hollowed out  so it might ring  true;  you are not the woman whittling ghosts  from a borrowed garden’s-worth of lilac.  & I am no river.    for how I starve    to love you?  it is more frivolous.    like skipping  rocks, like  on a lap, rocking,  how the river laps  against stone  until out  pours its bud    but, no,  I wouldn’t call your eyes  diamond saws.    when what I’d wanted  of your body  was sweet & pitiful & closer,  they were pursed; they were keen.    when what you’d held in your bell jar,  was a swam, remember? wasn’t it    a swarm not of bees,  but of bone?    & wasn’t the dragnet full  —not of stars,  but—of flecks?    let it be told:  I am no tender axe    for to fell you,  for to whet your asking  with a mouthful.  take.    what I’d wanted of your body  was no moonshine  & no fragrance  —not of the wax  or of its flower—    not the fever,  but its outbreak.    what I’d wanted  of your body  was no body,  but what comes after.    not ravishing or awash.  your palms not stained with plum.  your skin not sopping nectar.    what I want is not in question.    before your torrent  of fickle bee stings,    I am but a secondhand bouquet.    I am at the mercy  of your swarm, your dead-end  green, your petrified terrarium.       This is the first and only lesson. That a woman may die  at the hands of her children. In the Enuma Elish , for instance,    the world is molded from the body of an ocean  goddess, Tiamat. The she-dragon mourned a fresh water god,    but what can correct the loss of the beloved? Tiamat’s son  beat her skull in with a club to form the earth and heavens,    split her corpse down the spine like a glistening fish.  This is consistent with what I know of the cruelty of children.    When I was a girl, my mother removed her reproductive organs,  cut out a tumor as large and feathered as the inside of a grapefruit.    Even as a fetus I think I was spinning her uterus into a knot  of stars. Tunneling a path through the city, I still feed on her body, another    maggot in the goddess-carcass. So if I say I want to wrap my shoulders  in a canopy of my mother’s skin, really I mean, please, let me be    unlonely. Even when I can’t see you, I’m looking your way    and below, the crust of the planet tilts as though, half-formed,  a foot stretches against the plates. At one point, my mother tells me,    When I was in New York, I thought I was going crazy.  I was pregnant, carrying your brother home from surgery —    I don’t say I fucked a stranger recently or that between positions,  he slipped off the condom, which perhaps, is the easiest method    to expand the body into an ocean, then a serpent, then a corpse.  Nothing can correct the loss of my beloved on earth. A cold    wind blew up my skirt on the walk home and I didn’t know  if I stepped in something or if the rind of the city was always rot    and citrus. I kept wanting to slip from my skin, pry off my thigh  beads of semen with a knife, stop the whiteness from worming in. Our charts said “they feel radiant in each other’s company,” and it was true until I drove nine hours into another life. The officer that pulled me over didn’t question the tears that had been washing what remained of your body from mine. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done, but I stepped on the pedal and didn’t turn the wheel.    Under gray simulations of clouds, the forest was close and alive with your voice. The whole of the world came with it as I seeped into the green, while somewhere nearby another life wasn’t leaping forward, wasn’t beginning. The only way out seemed through the little red light on my cell phone, the ghost of a ghost. The presence of someone not. Blue rain fell and fell on a steel roof like some cosmic background noise, a drowning and resurrection. We only wanted sohbet.    I was two people; one of us had to die.    Nine hours and nine years later, my son is proof that the world is infinite. He is my fearless devotion to God’s will. He eats the cherries from our tree after I carefully remove the pits. He loves trains.    You are a photographer, and now you are an image. The sun leaping overhead is my sun, and impossibly it keeps setting, every descent a truism that things can change in time. They do. They always do, even though somewhere in our school’s garden a brick is poised in mute dedication, awaiting the only step that matters. The physicists say time is an illusion.    If so, this isn’t silence. This isn’t until further notice. This isn’t someday. This is just another me, still standing in the street, you on the curb, our hands entwined in the love of love, the Sun never setting. You call it homeland. Someplace  where rain runs down  grooves into the mouths of raccoons  or other urbanized animals,    but I have no direction to anything  but a half-hearted dive bar  or the nearest Burger King.  You have to understand    what geography means to me:  concrete, blacktop, fannys, runts.  To the right, you can find a marooned tree  with a misused condom at its base—I sat    in its grass, exhausted, only to find the sod  had not taken root. And there is no skyline  to speak of, there is no roll in the land,  you see too much, too far. Neighbors shutter    themselves, convinced that someone  is always looking. Learn little tactics  to stay connected: speak through sewer.  pipes, glass halls with buffed foil mirrors. How mythic, idealized—bellhops guiding golden  luggage carts, each of the Erotes chiseled into lobby  molding. All the framed landscapes to get lost in.  Here, there are so many rooms full of brief living. What else  to do but live out my fantasy: our bodies as impossible  to check out of. I can’t help but consider all the ways    this could end. Lying in bed, I hold you like I am  a filament—need quick lighting. Instead, you fold the stiff white  sheet over the down comforter as if we were home.  My side is resistant; seems not to care to be folded  just so. You reach over me, tuck it into the nape  of my armpit & kiss me goodnight. In the morning    I recount sculpting Himeros, winged god of no  distinct myth, in my sleep. Leaving early, I strap  my leather tote bag to my back—walk out  into daylight & rush hour traffic. Leaving early,  I’m uncertain I ever arrived. For my part, I wanted to live a little longer, despite the world as I knew it: burnt leather, coin-operated laundromat,  the constant wreckage. At the symphony an old man fell asleep next to me, while Carmina Burana  crooned of uncertainty, certain fatelessness. In life, I believed him a vagabond: vague movements reminiscent  of Trevi fountain pigeons. I named him Goliath—his robust breath having ravaged the symphony’s intermittent stillness. Afterwards,  the evening & its stillness. I walked into it—the park lights lit shapelessness making what it willed of my body.  How the stake prepares for the horseshoe— knows its violent affection. When the ringer comes the stake submits to its ringing.  This is how I give myself away. & perhaps after the dance party, from which people were leaving & to where people were still  arriving, too, you returned    to the car out on Jenkins, in front of the warehouse, where three men were standing,  shirtless in winter, taking hits from a meth pipe & you    said, excuse me, & got in your car, driving back to your apartment, a little high,  or just lonely, & perhaps you turned    back & offered them passage, to somewhere, your own home, a furnace since the heat  vents won’t close, & they took it, the ride    & your body, which you gave them, perhaps each one, however they elected  to take it & you offered no protest, said    take it, it’s yours now & after they used it, perhaps you said thank you & they left  to go nowhere, or back    to the party, from which people were still leaving & to where people were still  arriving, too, & perhaps to where you’ve also    returned, now thinking it better than nowhere, or right there, in your body, which is too full  of new bodies that have not yet got to dance. Queers play hopscotch. Queers shine at anything with jumping one-legged in and out of boxes. Queers keep things up their blue sleeves: rabbits, muscles, French cologne. Queers go overboard every time something new happens to enter. Vinegar potato chips. Buttery suede pants. Queers throw themselves into things. And it is true that they are frequently thrown.     Queer choirs queer music. A penny falls from a bad pocket, from a too-late hand, a shine down the leg, a tinkle. Queer goes down as far as possible and rolls away. Oh, Queer of gutter, Queer of the perverse Paris where the hunchbank hunches, where the phantom destroys the great chandelier before time does. Queer goes crying down on its audience, a thousand bits of quartz, glass, reflection. Queers have no reflection. Nor can they abide sandwiches.     Queer in the treetops turning white. Queer in the little rapids melting stone. If a queer is beaten to death is he all alone after the one who does it? Even with his alibi of panic? Even with his terror of being touched? Queer on the rock where the bicyclists turn on their nearly invisible trails among the trees. The body itself another stump. The body itself a kind of Scandinavian furniture we beat together because of the unreadable instructions.     Queer at home in the sexual. Queer who will answer in the absence of a parent who worries too much about safety to the detriment of listening. Who else treats the sea like a sister? Who else rips off the shirt it took several hours to buy? Queer at home watching TV too. The thing is queer won’t forget, even in the wee hours of the last breath, that it all was something. Queer’s mistake is not regret. Even the boredom was awake. When the sun tips out at midnight, When the roses bloom in autumn, And when the birds cease their scatting, And two times four is ten, and today Becomes the decibel of tomorrow, Maybe I’ll forget you then.

Today, I’m taking an epic  walk around the Hotel Del Coronado, sun-sonneteering,  head floral-crowned with grief: all his goings graces .  My métier a nevermorehappyeveraftering racket. Those who do not carry crosses carry  umbrellas. It’s a miracle, this water    contains electrolytes, promises  to restore my balance. It is stupid    to text your ex and blame her for  your nightmares. I’m happy you called.    It’s a comfort, the same man continuing  to die on the same day every year.    On my street there is no procession,  just a knife sharpening truck with a bell.    The Italian girl crying downstairs gives  me permission to need. It’s too much,    the same man continuing to be born  on the same day every year.    Sometimes you cut someone you love  from your life and it’s like refolding    a paper snowflake. Or it’s not.  I listen for the little girl downstairs.  We switched doctors often.  They asked too many questions.  How exactly did you break that arm?    When whacked, my knee never kicked back.  What if it had    with the momentum of apples  falling from the family tree?    The fields of my youth flattened  into burnt cream, curdled  over stripes of mud-pressed hay.    Limbs were swaddled  with blood-stained t-shirts.    Uncles missing thumbs and trigger-fingers—  I remember their rough nubs of scar tissue  tapping my forehead where a priest rubbed ashes.    I lost my father  to what I still don’t know. Not the hand, but the face it touches  Not the mother shushing, but the child    crying because he doesn’t understand:  the subway, the man with acid scars    on his face, hunger  Don’t be the family,    be its benevolent spirit  Be dead, be full    Not the tree, but the termite that eats it  Not the wood, but the throat that swallows the wood    Not the body, but its revenge,  its end:    I walked out of my life  and walked back into it    My lover says Not yet  I wake and eat pink clouds    My lover says Too soon  So there is a road    streaked with light  There is New Jersey    My lover says I want a son  Not the body but the star    Not the child, but the hope  that comes with the child    Not song, but prayer         Alabanza that it will not be this cough that claims him          after these 90-something years it is the South         that will end him           and I say South meaning that I come from somewhere where a nation is only a translation for what had to be abandoned in the jaw of a pistol beneath my Abuelo’s chest shriveled patches of land threaded with gunpowder  Abuelo argues to return to Santo Domingo and we remind him that it was an argument that brought us here in the first place it was the journey to Washington Heights that begged him to shred his lungs and now the dust of his ingles swirls a soft storm             and he is old too old for anything          that does not promise wings and a good burial an airplane will kill him           but so will the staying he mumbles my name        and home in a language we inherited           from a pistol he uses our hands to deny the disease and I know he has used my fingers to cradle a cigarette and kiss it like an exile he does not care if he dies if he is home for the dying speaks only           What he would give           to mount the sky carrying only two little bags full of sulfur if you could hear him cough        you would swear it sounds like somebody he loved fumbling desperately for the exit. My grandmother clasped cousin Stella’s hand, divining the heart  of things: the only house she’d buy would burn in the spring,  daughters’ dresses floating through windows. (It’s not something  to say in polite company.) yet our bodies  trouble to make moon-eyed children ), I’ve buried my mother’s hallelujahs & salt-throwing grandmother’s prophecies ( she said I was in love,  she was wrong ) in the sea’s dark oil. Still, I touched José’s arm, & saw his mother slap him for pissing on the floor & he hated me for it. The third eye’s gate swings open, letting visions in and out as horses. I asked my grandmother, who baked doughy babka & lifted her hands’ glowing bones to make the sign of the cross, who do you watch? Now, she’s gone & I’m lonely, knowing all bright things pass away. On the other side, women laboring in the saint-fields grow younger, she told me, touching chin whiskers. Here, I carry others’ lives, incessant bird-noise suffering. I split myself over & over, then sew these little deaths inside my pelvis. I cry to be carried. Because we all long for something to quiet us down. Tell me , the living & dead say, you’ll see me even when my ash. Consider your hair and  skin oil, sweet potatoes  and mung bean— that you die  young, always. Because I  separated from you,  closeness is symmetry  with evenly developed  muscle groups. I tried jajangmyeon (자장면)  the “deep fried sauce,” the “spring taste.”  Tusk-like-teethed animals are  being hunted. i ain’t got time for that  i’m too busy in tha mornin’ washin’ my face scrubbin’ this high yellow skin clean  polishin’ my one-sixteenth pearly white-privilege glassy eyed, green  by afternoon time, real Negro women despise or envy me  cuz i ain’t got time to debate the word “nigga” i’m too busy bein’ a token bein’ “progressive” & keepin’ my white friends in line  i ain’t writin’ nobody’s negro poetry i simply ain’t got time  i’m too busy tamin’ my naps & pretendin’ that “can I touch it?” is innocent a truce, a compliment  & too busy in the evenin’ commanding my language no tongue-clickin’ no Motherland-ish niggardly English  too busy for the one drop rule & all dat bullshit too busy for nasty words like mulatto ain’t even got time to name the rest  i ain’t writin’ nobody’s negro poetry cuz it don’t be usin’ the right wordin’ & frankly, it’s too busy writin’ one side of an already one-sided story  it’s too busy for a great-great grandmother rollin’ in the sheets that she spent that mornin’ steamin’ too busy for that kind-a slave woman straddlin’ the hips of the whippin’ post gettin’ a new kind-a lashin’ breathless, screamin’ Massa  i ain’t got time for negro poetry cuz it ain’t got time for my legacy  it ain’t got time for a  gray-area, in-between,  white-washed, house-nigga,  pretty-eyed, high-yella Negro Woman like me      You have been Small Character too.  Perhaps that’s the kernel of your deep sympathy. Lost in the woods and discovering all your cleverly laid bread crumbs eaten up by the even more clever birds. Who wrote those birds into my story?  Why did I wear this thin and flimsy nylon jacket instead of a substantial wool overcoat? You regard all your own Small Characters, enclosed in holding pens or pacing their garrets.  Perhaps you wish mightily to be merciful.  And then you turn away.  You take down the beautiful cages made of living branches and release the birds.  They are hungry and sure to find the bread crumb trail which gleams like a comet’s tail through the dark night. Sitting Small Character down for a hair cut.  Unlike a doll, you can cut his hair over and over.  You can close your eyes and make it grow again.  Changing his hair is good practice.  Imagine having to do worse things.  Say letting his girlfriend charge out of their shabby trailer home.  Letting his liver swell.  Letting his back stoop.  Cutting off his unemployment check.  At least here, right now, at the beginning you can have compassion.  You can wrap a hot towel over his face.  You can splash his thin cheeks with bay Rum and stand him upright, pulling the strings tighter and tighter, so he stands at his full height with something like dignity.        Because it’s the rhythm, repetition, that sweet hollowing   of our mouths around the words— not the words themselves—    that repair the sky, we enter his absence silently,    as arable light, as a disavowed country returned to, hesitantly, knowing everything has changed,    as bullets melted down and cast into bells.    No grace.      No atonement.      No mass graves turned to temples turned to proof    some seas can be parted. Some seas can be parted. Some seas    sound like our teeth parting, then biting down on whatever we’ve been told    might help. The cost of belonging ,    he would say, before looking down at his hands. From wherever we plant our hands now    grows    a small house by a bay    we cannot escape, a tin roof and rain as it percusses a tin roof, soaks into our hair, and becomes no longer rain;    father, here it is:    a makeshift altar of votive candles—one after another after another almost- fallen star, with maybe a few fallen stars; no atonement,    grace, maybe alms, maybe your harness. Leave dates of entry, exit and all periods  of residency. We step from reception room    to interview room. It looks nameless because  it is nameless. Some notes ask if disease  caused—other forms refer to trauma.    The ofﬁcers say, answer for yourselves,  without prompt. We acknowledge danger  everywhere. It feels nameless because    it is nameless. We cannot seem to move beyond years  of waiting rooms, ears given to ringing. We use our children  to measure time, generations ﬁll in the page as aid ﬁeld.    With each step, further into an enormous airplane hangar.  The light is dazzling. We cannot quite see it. Driving back from breakfast on the coast  you stopped to pick up a hitchhiker,  because we have said all the things we can say to each other.    Her wool cap straddled a swarm of white hair  rushing around itself like the foaming waves behind her.    You asked her where she was going. She said, “I’m a history major,”  as if there was only one place any historian could ever go from this moment  on Chuckanut Road halfway between Seattle and Vancouver.    She got in.  We moved on.    She told us the president didn’t want her to have her Kool Menthols,  how the gas station attendants are told to hide them from her,  how it was worse under Bush, better under Clinton.  She didn’t know where she was going only that she had this inheritance, she didn’t touch it she  swears, but that meant she couldn’t go to homeless shelters or receive government aid but  there was a motel in Anacortes she knew she just couldn’t remember the name right now  and she didn’t have any money but she wanted to go there anyway and did we know the  name of it?  You dropped her off at the cheapest motel we knew, unloaded her luggage, drove away. Deer Skull with Pedernal, Georgia O’Keefe, 1943, oil on canvas    Nourished by hide and marrow  a tree sprouted beneath him  rose crooked between his ribs  branched through his nostrils and pulled  the young buck up from the earth  let each vertebrae tumble  down its twisting veins of bark.  Hooves landed with a patter  on spring grass; each tibia  cracked the other as they fell.  When only his head remained  perched on slate-gray branches,  the vultures’ sickle beaks came  to pick him clean, rake his bone.  On his temples, he wore two  gems of the blue ombre sky.  On his head, he wore sun-flushed  antlers like a blushing crown. i. el coco   without shape,  i take a child. cloak myself in  the shadow of a room. look through  an iron pan with holes. façade for a face,  a candle wick burning behind it. i want to  tend to a thing, watch it grow, & hear it say  i love you back. run my hand along  my child’s soft cheek. a caress. wipe the tears from  their eyes. tell my child te quiero ,  kiss their forehead, & take  them away.    ii. chupacabra   i undress  the warmth  in the body    draw all  the red out  of flesh &    am called  an abomination  in moonlight    i watch  tended herds  i christen    each creature’s  tender neck  before breaking    the body gone  slack i empty  its veins    i bless it  with smoke i utter  a prayer oh lord    spare me  for taking a life  to preserve    my own    iii. la llorona    & see what i would do for love? submerge  the likeness of us until it no longer breathes.  devote myself to my own drowning. let my hair  become a trail of smoke underneath the water.  cry out beside a river until it is a lullaby. the river-  bed a cradle i lower all of the children into.  mis hijos. i am sorry. every face looks like yours. as a child i watch mami sit in limbo    with other righteous people & infants who were not drowned. put there by a wrathful country who thinks itself a god. a tiny flame gnaws at the border of mami’s dress. she puts it out with her palm. here, they take her fingerprints & know the shape of her hands. at the front desk a lady tells her i am sorry ma’am, but your paperwork was misplaced in the mouth of a whirlwind. we’ll have to restart your application . & mami sits inside that somber room for another two years. on the wall, a picture of the president looks over everyone. mami’s stay is provisional but she is terrified of how law can be read & carried out. how under different eyes her step on the soil becomes unlawful. she sits stiff in a foreign plastic chair. unable to swim back across a rusted river pushing two bodies away from one another. i am from here, but mami is my first home. i don’t know how to hold anything—can be taken. a mexican walks into a bar    & he is the only brown person there. la piedra del sol is printed on every black vinyl stool. quetzal feathers  dangle from the ceiling. sugar calaveras hang on the walls. & the punch line is plunder. a pale hand emptying an image  of blood for decoration. he walks to the counter, orders a beer. the white bartender pours beer from the boy’s  mouth & serves it to a white girl wearing a serape & fake mustache at the end of the bar. the brown boy shrivels  into corn husks & the bartender wears him over his pale skin. he takes his skull, dips it in sugar, paints  it in sparkling blues & pinks. abuelita stands at the concrete washboard     & lays out abuelito’s shirt   along the ridges. turns   on the faucet & a small river   falls out. fills    a plastic bowl with water  & pours it over  the cloth. yesterday he slit  a pig’s throat & fed    his eight children, but the blood  stained his sleeve.  she takes a bar of soap  & rubs the cotton against    the concrete until the life  of last night’s meal comes  out. she squeezes the damp shirt  & the water hiding in it runs    into the mouth at the end  of the washboard. she hangs  the shirt on a clothesline  in the sun. the wind runs through it.    it smells of lavender. I.  Sit in the diner. Wait for her to arrive. Gaze at the sun in the wall. Pull out your phone. Slide  your thumb across the screen. Look up & smile when she walks through the door. In two weeks  she is 19. Watch her search through lips & eyes undone with hunger. Wave your hand. Stand  as she walks to the table. Listen to the screech of home in the hug you share. Ask her how  she’s doing. Sit down. Watch her hair bend in the August of her fingers. She tells you she’s tired but  she’s good. She asks you what’s new. You tell her about the latest fight you’re having with your man.  She shakes her head & laughs. She tells you about the Craigslist date she had last night & how her pimp  took all the money. Bread crumbles in your hand.  II.  Jump when you hear the ring. See an unfamiliar number appear on your screen. Pick up the phone. Try to hide  the worry in your voice. Say hello. Her voice is loaded with bricks. She says he left her stranded. He took her  purse. No phone. No money. No cigarettes. She is in New Jersey. She is cold. He is gone. She is crying. You are not  breathing. You close your eyes & curse him again. She tells you he wants to teach her a lesson. You ask her what  she needs you to do. She says she’ll figure it out & call back. She doesn’t. You try to sleep but fail. The sun  rises. You call her phone again. He picks up. You ask him where she is. He calls you a bitch & tells you to mind  your business. You call him a piece of shit. Promise him he will pay. Demand to speak her now. He sucks his teeth  & click. You call back. He hits ignore. You call again. He picks up. He passes her the phone. She says hello. You ask  if she’s okay. Your chest is lava. She says she’s okay now. You sigh & tell her there’s no home in this life. She  tells you not to worry & that she’s really okay.  III.  It’s spring break. You meet her at a bar. It’s been weeks since you last spoke. You’re late. She looks at you in  annoyance. You laugh & apologize. She tells you she’s left him. You inhale. She says she works for herself now.        My lover told the air not to come around here anymore. It doesn’t matter that I wear the pleading so well. How my chest holds a sickness only my lover’s watch could have implanted. Saturday morning & no ray in sight as he sits in a dorm room chair just big enough to keep him from falling. He calls me over. Gives me 10 seconds or he’ll teach me an old lesson. The skin surrounding my right eye is still dyed black from his fist the last time his voice fell from his lips that way. 10. Lord, where are your arms? 9. Will today be the day dead bees fall out of me? 8. The inner winding organs rust with hunger. 7. How many balled hands will it take to collapse into numbers? 6. His foot tap against the floor sounds like sunken birds. 5. Will I remember what it feels like to be a woman lodged in an occasional love? 4. I want to be soft beyond the orbit of these veins. 3. I’m ready to bury the gamble. 2. Who has the recipe for making a feast with scraps of time? 1. I sprint to his arctic lap—can he hear me conjure wrists disappeared into wildfire?        How many men have I taken. Swung from the tips of my fingers. Led to a lake of silk-wet sheets. The lovers of gasoline, brick dust, the zenith of this twenty-ninth year. Their hair dewed with late rain. In a red pickup I sit with a black-haired woman who calls me mama , let myself lean into her talk of border-crossing, her gritty fingernails tapping my forearm. She tells me that she died on this day, in a past life where she was a curandera . The bartender kicked us out; I let her lips skim my earlobe. Yes, I am domestic. I love my husband like a fire loves Californian brush. But there is nothing like two women quick as jaguars in the Texan dark, our madness catching up to us. I coveted your spine. That glossy brown topography of darting muscles and sinew, a string of bone-pearls keeping you erect. I believed it: a good fight is better than a good man.  It was Oklahoma. I was seven, my heart was broken, and you were the most beautiful woman I’d ever seen. O god, the bruises, bodies flung against ring ropes, a man named Hunter to love. I loved you best all rewilding: hooker-red lipstick, waxed thighs, black leather for miles.  The women I knew feared the fist; not you. When your action figure came out, I bought two. I made your plastic legs part. Seven became ten became twenty-two. What I mean is I drank and snorted. What I mean is I tore bread so the birds would come. I watched your sex tape to see if you’d cry. I wanted to see the secrets of a woman who had none.  You dove into a fish tank once, after too many cocktails. You had to be yanked out. They called it lunacy but I know you did it for the slow resurface, black hair plastered wetly against bare breasts. The great fall of , screamed the headline. A woman can spend a lifetime wiping a man from her thighs.  Chyna, I went for a run yesterday and realized it was spring already, the trees shaking their Marie Antoinette wigs into a savage green. The fog lifted as I ran; the world brightens with or without us. Here’s life. Myths that scuttle into nothing like arks breaking the sea. The Victorians had it right: a woman needs a world that makes her small. But you already knew that, didn’t you. The crows are restless—a fox nearby. And I think, this is holy. The river and sky both the colour of wanting, reflecting like sisters.  As we pass the old house, my mother tells me not to look too closely. Window ledges peeling, grass untrimmed,  a brickwork exhalation. Don’t tell me not to mourn the Butler sink in the kitchen where she lathered lavender soap  between my toes and her hands, washing until the shadow of soil fell from my skin.  Tonight we will sit without jackets, feel the sunlight leave rather than see it,  watch the fleeting silhouettes born skyward from the trees then settling, once again. i said  yo my man  you sell kool aid  you do  you’re the bomb brother    while pulling out my EBT card  i felt someone/something  grilling my back  i turned & saw this young sister  you know her kind    dread lock    shell wearing  it’s about unity  the mother land and shit    she smirked  rolled her eyes  her attitude told me she thought  i’m another useless do ragging brother  she disgustedly turned her back on me    i don’t know what stopped me from screaming  yo sister i didn’t sign up to live on a tight rope  have mercy   every day   i pray for a better life  i deserve the same love   respect    you text about. jerrod wasn’t planned love kept him growing in my womb my g.e.d.  r.n. was for him i gave him things i never had kisses     hugs     hearing i love you every day jerrod was never a regret  he makes me forget my once bitter life  jerrod loves art that’s how i got to know a basquiat from a monet he taught me programming      french jerrod isn’t perfect i’m his drill sergeant they’ll be no numbers under his photo i don’t know why/when/how jump shots became my nerd’s passion jerrod loves manning up/playing with the big dogs  he makes me forget my once bitter life  what you mean       Jerrod laying out on the court they mistook him for       who blood of my blood drained gone      no   no   no lord jesus     jesus lord     how could you curse my womb i can’t get this bitter taste out of my mouth  jerrod’s gone i can’t forget my once bitter life.

Miles away you spot the plastic duck, the huntsman’s  bluff, and the blood you’d spill  you spare not a drop  in letters sealed in wax and signet  ring. In plans to rebuild cities  and bridges, you’d tag without ceremony  the poems of Walt Whitman and Hart Crane.  You drive everywhere in a city that goes against  the natural laws of the city itself, always on time  except one cold Thanksgiving where you couldn’t find  that last stop  Flushing hole-in-the-wall.  Under a canopy of plastic tarp, shivering  on plastic stools around a charcoal-heated table,  we spoke of this world ending, and you listed your abilities  to fight off viruses, volcanoes, tsunamis  even yourself  if bitten by monkey, mosquito,  your own mother.  Eat well , she says for the many things  we over-say. Eat well , I’d offer  my bones for soup and what little flesh I have,  lest the infection unleashes  the kind of hell that leaves  but an unkindness  of ravens  playing in fresh snow.  One more night we knew  we’d see tomorrow. One more night  drunk and alive in the depths of Queens,  carousing with cooks in open-air kitchens,  how we swore our lives on those  ducks strung up in their windows  in which we will gather our sorrows,  those last days  of cloth napkin and unsullied blade  readied at the long, long table. Eat well,  dear friend. Eat well,  my blood brother. I unzip fava beans and pop  them out of their thick shells,  separating them from  what sustained their growth,  as my friend’s son chirps  in his newfound voice.  I palm each fat comma.  I want to fill the world  with daughters not my own  but ones who learn how  to braid, are mesmerized  by stones. Thank God I had  daughters , my mother  would repeat. Until she didn’t.  Some seeds beside ones  that look ready to burst  have shriveled up, my labor  for their flesh in vain.  All I can do is promise.   I was pretty but not too pretty.    I kept my head down to count    sidewalk cracks, perpetually nodding.    Agreeable, always. A no that sighed    to yes . Easy to bend. The shock    when I emerged year after year,    trying to choose a direction,    following a simulacrum of who    I could be. I shuddered off my petals.    I grew all stamen, all unfruitful sex. The unruly mango pit you gave up on peeling from my teeth.  Send yourself to bed without supper. Boil water and refuse that tea  I kept for years for a special occasion that never arrived.  Suck on honeysuckle blossoms, their fleeting sweetness enough  of this earth. The unopened jam jars and shrub in the pantry soured  from ants and mold. A promise, a primrose, a poison, soaked  and plumped for molds I fill with cake batter but never bake. The shadow of the wing    You who think I don’t believe  when we two feud  do not imagine my desire,  my thirst, my hunger for God;    nor have you heard my desolate  cry that echoes through  the inner place of shadow,  calling on the infinite;    nor do you see my thought  laboring in ideal genesis,  frequently in distress  with throes of light.    If my sterile spirit  could own your power of birth,  by now — I would have columned heaven  to perfect your earth.    But tell me, what power stows  within a flagless soul  to carry anywhere at all  its torturer — who knows? —    that keeps a fast from faith,  and with valiant integrity  goes on asking every depth  and every darkness, why?    Notwithstanding, I am shielded  by my thirst for inquiry —  my pangs for God, cavernous and unheard;  and there is more love in my unsated  doubt than in your tepid certainty.  And why shouldn’t it be true that there’s a soul?  What labor does it cost God, who fibrils  the phosphorescent tulle of the nebulae,  who veins brushstrokes so subtle  of light on the comets that never fail,  to give immortality to the spirit?  Is it more incomprehensible, by chance,  to be reborn than to be born? Is it more absurd  to go on living than to have lived,  to be unwitnessed and exist, as around  us here throb and exist  numberless forms that science  surprises every instant  with its lynx eyes?  Hope, our commonplace bread;  hope, nurse of the wretched;  murmur to me those intimate words  that in silent night feign,  in the inmost obscurity of my mind,  whispers of white seraphim …  Isn’t it true that I will encounter my dead?  If you know, why do you not inform?  My soul is a princess in her tower closed  gazing on life through five little windows.  She is a mournful goddess prisoned by the body.  And your soul, which flew before you died,  is a brilliant wing, thoroughly freed …  You are not the ghost; the ghost is I!    What do I understand of things! To me, things offer  not what they truly are, but how they appear  to the five senses with which God holds at bay  my bulky sensorium, my tenuous perceiving.  You know all today … I, rather, know nothing!  You are not the ghost; the ghost is I! You can cut the spinal cord, crush it, remove a segment, and it will regenerate. You can cut the limbs at any level—the wrist, the elbow, the upper arm—and it will regenerate, and it’s perfect. There is nothing missing, there’s no scarring on the skin at the site of amputation, every tissue is replaced. They can regenerate the same limb 50, 60, 100 times. And every time: perfect.  – Scientific America, April 2011    Tu me dices: you are losing  the animal  within.  Y yo digo nada.  How can you  battle  a diety.  Instead I ask,  how many  times  have you offered  your arms?  How many?   How   do you   describe   infinite.  70  x 7.  The nervous system.  Transmutations. Re-calibrated.  Spine.  Re-  stacked.  Eres guardia? Or guarded?  And you welcome  silence  with  space,  with  quiet.  So I must consider  your revival alone:  the monstrance  opening.  And my tied  tongue  to knees.   Enseñame.  Undeed this  border.  Make me  explain  Xochimilco,  canaled.  Nunca  libre.  Brain  clipped.  Dolor.  A synapse  lodged  between  dendrites:  una viuda, a retina, nulo, todo, a trucing fissure, a wand.  Olvidado  es el hueso.  A chip, abandoned.  You finally say,  Do this  in memory of me.  As if  I  could   tragar un lago   and the cortex could    steed,    spear,   and  war   the  blood.  Then  you ask me:  what remains   cuando has   deshecho   scars and reconstruiste   the self?    Gruñidos.    Yes. Growls.    Or simply,    virga gathering    in drought. At age 7 you plunge from the top of a walnut tree only to be saved & swallowed  by a red ant hill. The pinhole an entrance of undulations around hardpan & root. You grasp  that ants understand infinity in their relentless caves, that to escape is to dig deeper into dark. You  accept this labyrinth as life & taste earth from the inside. The ants do not say  they desire to cave your body, tunnel your organs & marrow, but you feel this ache  from your hand, now flame & fire & punctures from a colony of mandibles, now a glove  burning & dancing to your agony. The ants take the hand. You ask to leave but learn  ants have no ears. You swipe them away, only they return. You swipe them  away, only they return. You swipe them away, only they return. You see how they now devour  both hands & discover ants will fight to the death. You do not pray, but gnaw  at your hands. The ants see you will feed & scuttle off. You bleed & watch  the ants remake their hill & disappear. The stars whistle & your hands swell. Never have I been a wife. Nor a mother. Someone slides a map of America under my chair. Clouds the color of grids, you’ll find my nationalism there, a dead XY method. If I could give birth right now, if I could will speech to a shore, an arboretum of nylon would exit my body. Pull the orange tyrant from my thighs, for example, cue the search engines to amass every definition of machine. Machine once meant “I can”—at a later point, slang for “vagina.” Grab her by the machine. Can I. Declaratives under false pretenses of order, a slogan for example. Make. The one time a mother smacked me clean across the face, I made the weather. A rock fell through light is how I forgave her. Let me forgive her. Contained in the word “self ” is not to inherit. The word “self ” once the reflexive third person pronoun: a contradiction in invention, the way the tongue can’t lick itself without itself. I have lost, for example, a vitality somewhere in the repetition of waking. The Lord selects her diction. Cemetery. Arrow. That may be chosen. When I elect to speak a plot falls from my mouth. August groped me with sticky fingers, the oppressive heat of the Chihauhaun desert slamming my pores closed with a gasp. We make nopales and spend the day slicing frozen brains like deli meat. I am researching addiction and the results are inconclusive. This is my best attempt at using science to wrestle my mother’s dirty names into the sand. We are trying to prove that addiction is what happens when normal joy defects. The friends not so friendly, the food not so filling- loneliness’ big sister, fat with rage, careless in her hunger. Sometimes I imagine the roles switched. The vodka yearning for my mother while she’s away at work. The glass beading with need for her hands. Huitlacoche from Juarez circles the cramped table, and we talk about where we come from. I try to speak, but cannot hear myself over the ice crashing together in some far away glass. I think I’m screaming “I study addiction because it’s interesting. No particular reason.” The creosote tinges the wind, makes the wooden crosses smell deeply of gasoline. It’s funny how you devote your life to things you’re scared of. the house is heavy with sour burning fish / when i leave / my clothes will smell / of seared salmon / sulking men on the train / will tidy their backs / twist their necks / in my direction / assume my thighs used bait / you know the thing we learn in grade school / about cheap girls’ bodies / how they carry the sea / i make the train smell like gowanus / trash river lady / all for you / you are back home writing a book / on the kitchen floor / told me this morning / you met someone else / she lives in europe / but you have more in common / like religion / your names / sound nice together / i ask for my things / you give me a garbage bag / i ask for my coat / you beg me to leave it / it smells like you / you say / the last time we made love / you asked me / if i was scared / i think you wanted me / to say yes / when we go to bed / all of the women scale the fire escape / perch on the rust / cackle and sing / you can tell how much he loves her / by how he sleeps / not at all / not at all / not at all. I am nine. We are bored and Karen is dying.  We drove to Austin that summer so Sarah’s dad—  who described Karen as the great and impossible love of his life, who taught us  the word lymphoma and then, the concept of the prefix, how it explains where the tumor lives—  could say goodbye.  The house is a rind spooned out by the onset of death, what’s left is a medicine cabinet  full of razors & we are hungry & alone & sitting on the living room floor  where the light from a naked window slices the hardwood  like melon, brandishes each, individual fuzz on my scabbed calf  a field of erect, yellow poppies & we have been alive as girls long enough to know  to scowl at this reveal & what better time than now to practice removal.  Once, I watched my mother skin a potato in six perfect strokes  I remember this as Sarah teaches me to prop up my leg on the side of the tub  and runs the blade along my thigh, See? she says, Isn’t that so much better?  Before we left Albuquerque her father warned us, She will have no hair  a trait we have just begun to admire  except, of course for the hair he is talking about that which we hold against our necks,  that which will get us husbands or compliments or scouted in a mall,  eventually cut off by our envious sisters while we sleep. We live in the pursuit of halcyon, an elation with wings that will open us & complement our earthly nakedness. How we aspire for a blessing, the one we don’t deserve, even on our best day, the one who will hold us in the snow in green mountains & in Paris taxis, laughing & sharing cigarettes & Serifos. We live for a patient ear, for the keeper of blue secrets & our whole, long lives. We look up believing—how we live for song-wide smiles to reunite Pangaea, as if never a sea between, when both the day & night are equal & luminous. Knees worn green, hands clayed with sand & muck, I wear my life pursuit, no less a bruise. I persist bed making in sweat & stain for idylls in spring. What emerges from such ambition? My open palm cradles each seed, sun-dried hope from a three-chambered pod like a frog heart, amphibious throb of suckle & thrust. The organic engine muscles Demeter’s alchemy, a knuckled promise held tight. There is no vanity in birth. Polaroid (poh-la-roid) n. quickly developing image forever seared in memory.    Use it in a sentence:    Dressed as Charlie Chaplin for a junior high party, I reached into the pocket of the coat I borrowed from my father and pulled out three Polaroids of a naked woman lying on my mother’s bed.    Write a poem using each letter of the word as the first letter of each line:    Polaroid   Posed naked  on my mother’s bed  lies a woman—she’s  as open as my mouth is  right now.  Oh, daddy—tell me how  I am supposed to  dance tonight.         I fingerprint the sky  Take the nearest exit    (& they are legion)  ) & they are without relent(    My racing mind    & its multitudes  & its voices    Becomes portent    What I’m trying to say is  What I’m trying to say is    I seek a guidance system    To be pilot not passenger  Primal not prey. I was afraid to close my eyes,  scared He’d get me in bed—  my thin body covered  by a sheet with Peanuts characters.    Every night I’d scream, but no one  ever came, until I wondered  if I was making any noise at all—  my throat raw with disappointment.    God watched me for months—  eyes two pinpricks of light—glaring  down from the ceiling’s light fixture.    When I finally told him,  my father waited until dark,  turned out the lights,  and tracked the eyes to their source­—  a reflection cast by my nightlight.    Did my father fix it out of love?  Or was he worried God  would see what he was doing? Tonight I’ll be a dust mote on the red desk. An ant crawling outside the house. Tonight I’ll slip between my shadow and yours. Lock my door. Hide in the closet. Cover myself with caution tape. Bathe in trash. Tonight I’ll be the rabbit’s heartbeat and quivering nose. I’ll pretend I’m dead. Pretend I’m on Mars. Tonight I’ll forget.  Tonight I’ll speak in tongues. Tonight I’ll fly at you— become a hundred palmetto bugs. Sting you like a jellyfish. Watch from the ceiling. Film everything. Take notes. Hide inside a book. Call on God. Jesus. Buddha. Kali. Granny. Tonight I’ll forget.  Tonight you’ll cry before. During. After. Tonight you’ll admit you’ve done wrong. You’ll stop. You’ll stop. You’ll stop. Tonight I’ll forget.  Tonight you’ll stay the fuck away. Get help. Get me help. Tonight it ends. Tonight I’ll fight back. Tonight I’ll forget.  Tonight I’ll kill you in your sleep. Tonight I’ll cut myself. Swallow pills. Kill myself. Tonight I’ll forget.  Tonight I’ll stare you in the eyes the whole time and make you watch. Tonight I’ll forget.  Tonight.  Forget.  Tonight. Every morning the stones on the sternum: opening.  Every morning another chapter where the hero  is a woman slurred between forested fatigues, the flesh of her stomach  unspooling into yarn.   Who is the cannibal now?  Every morning the birds falling backwards out of the sky  like a film in reverse, the feathers collecting  in my palms like rosary beads.   How I could bless the sin out of my ribs —  Dear So-and-So: I’m sorry I never answered your calls.  Dear So-and-So: I’m sorry I answered your call  & wept like a storm drain for six years, the receiver  a canefield emptied of its plumage.  You want a better story.  I understand.  Who wants to hear a story where the subject  is an empty room, a closed door?  The mountains in Fujian, then, where some grandmother of mine  incubates herself with a prayer softened by waiting, her sons  folded beneath her sternum. Like a nun on fire,  opening towards her God, her white blouse spread across the stone pillars  like mist into the lungs. Or Victory Strikes &  procaine lifted to my grandfather’s lips  to bless himself out of the air,  burn the night sky into prophecy:  an augur  scrying for his daughter’s pallid face.  Or  a woman in a San Francisco night, her black eyes  gleaming like Orion, rising to meet you.  Her red dress unfurling beneath your hands.    Dear So-and-So: you’ve never been to San Francisco,  & this is not a happy ending.  Dear So-and-So: there is no happy ending,  no slain dragon or high priestess or gleaming knight  waiting at the end of this sentence  to gather you against their breast, kiss you on both  of your cheeks, everyone weeping, everyone saying,   my dear So-and-So, we were just kidding,   real life is so much better than this .  Dear So-and-So, when we were in the psych ward  everyone asked us what we wanted to be when we grew up  & everyone said happy but we all meant autocannibal .  I remember all those boys with eyes that say Run, Run, Run .  Dear So-and-So, I remember the story so well.  Your lips brown & chapped like the bark of a baobab,  our palms coated with patina. How we sat in the sun  and watched birds plummet, beak-first, into the concrete,  Apollo blazing the sun through our hands.  So-and-So, they called me dogeater & Philomela ,  tongue dissolving through my fingers  into Atlantic spume, all my dead friends  passing through me like a summer wind. My neck  a cardinal between their teeth.  That day someone had tried to smash the psychiatric windows  like shucking a coconut, then cut himself open & fleshed into the ground.  So-and-So, these were the first stones.  Dear So-and-So,  here is the day where you call my mouth aripiprazol  & tear your cousins into roots. Here is your tongue, not a tongue.  Your body unsure if it wants to become a body.  Here’s the moment you named serotonin , a torch  whittled between your lips,  your mouth an exit wound.  Dear Forgiveness,  sit down at the table  & let me anoint you with patchouli & salts.  Dear Forgiveness:  Won’t you come in, scorch the ward into a cathedral  of red-lipped sky.  I know, So-and-So. The world is a big place. We were all just kidding .  Come in.  There are so many things I want to tell you. Summers we throw  rocks at the impending  depredation of the Amtrak  on the Colorado landscape.  Our whole neighborhood  of shirtless brown boys  throw, with all of our might,  at the Plexiglas windows,  to watch the rocks explode  in the faces of the white travelers,  as the brown residue frames  their condescending faces.  We imagine a tour-guide  saying, To the right  are some of the natives  in a British accent, so we  keep throwing our limestone  rocks and as the last car  is hit with our primitive weapons,  Isaac says Remember the  Alamo, at which we all laugh  for no reason.        that summer I say a blessing over every dead thing I eat or cry over or both. I grind my teeth until they can no longer stand to touch each other and I can’t bite into anything anymore anyway. one day I wake wearing the sweat-soaked bedsheets like a rancid seatbelt. outside, people are singing happy birthday the entire day long. I paint the word agency onto both of my big toes to prove a point. I pray text my mother and suppose that it is painful to become anything. later that month I turn a corner and run into a breeze strong enough to shock me back into my own body. I guess there isn’t really anything besides uncertainty. I guess if I’d stayed there long enough I could have become the asphalt itself. what do you think would’ve happened if I’d just sat in the driver’s seat and let the cloud of fruit flies swallow me whole. what is it that makes a colony a colony. how long do you think it takes for them to shrug their wings and figure that a body is as close as it needs to be to an apple core in a cupholder left to its own rot. In those days,  we ate watermelon like steak—   with tobiko and fish flakes  we sharpened our knives    with amber roe. I used  my tongue then—    I flicked  fat into the river    to watch it crescent—  and roll. With the grainbeads    of melon, we played.  Thought the marbles of water    could be so finicky—  and unlovely. Quarried in Italy, hewn in America,  cosseted by San Francisco, uncorseted by Hollywood,  widowed by smallpox, remarried in Mexico,  comrade of Pablo, paramour of Diego, betrayer of Frida,  documentarian of the starkly colored murals of Jose Clemente  with their ruthless turbines and lurid vivisections,  photographer of farmhands and unionists,  of women with speckled brown pendulous breasts  and babies with hair as soft and hot as the fine snow  flicked from a cigarette,    muse of the Mexican Communist Party,  target of Italy’s fascist police,  suspect in two assassinations,  smeared by state-run newspapers as a tiger-clawed pistolera ,  detained, interrogated, exiled, and finally eliminated,  Tina Modotti  a seamstress’s daughter  renounced photography at 35:  “I can’t solve life’s problems by losing  myself in art’s.” One white man  pummels another.  The referee’s  a diminutive figure  in café-au-lait pants,  prim black cravat.    Ringside, men in suits,  not a hair out of place,  observe the bloodsport  with relish,  flailing their hands,  holding aloft  camel fedoras,  forming O-shapes  with their mouths.  They cringe away  when Firpo belts Dempsey  hard, sending his milky torso  flying over taut  boundary ropes.    They’re hungry for gore.  It’s not what kills them. George  Bellows, who painted the scene,  died, 42,  of a ruptured appendix. 1.  We corner the seawall and before us  a stony minefield of shards, lances, knifepoints—  in my water shoes, I balance on the tips. Surely,    anyone would think us tourists, gringos,  but in El Salvador every pastoral landscape  is framed by a jagged blade.    We spy a man positioned on a cliff top, binoculars in hand,  and I wonder if we should turn around,  if he is waiting for a drop    because here, drug runners and fishing boats wear the same guise,  pockets of cocaine sewn into fish bellies,  the Gulf of Fonseca, portal to three countries, crooked hallway    between South America and USA. Or maybe  because it is the season of black-tipped terns,  the man on the cliff top is a hopeful birdwatcher;    gulls pluck at dragonflies threading the sky, pelicans dive-bomb fish,  but he gears his binoculars to the flashing colors of the fishing boats  as their wakes cut across the blue seam.      2.  At the mud flats  clam diggers squat hip deep  in the tide pools,   one arm embraces the top  of a rock, as the other  rounds the bottom,   gloved fingers crab-like, walk the base  of the rocks, to pull the black  and white mollusks from their beds.   Children splash naked  in the shallows,  gaunt dogs patrol the hot sand.   I approach a woman in a desert-army cap  and ask if they eat them in soup,  or cooked with rice.   She looks up and her light green eyes  wrinkle, Asi hacemos nuestras vidas , this  is how we make our lives;   and crouching next to her, a boy  of three or four smashes a fat white clam  against a rock to suck it raw.      3.  Each step shrugs off the water’s grip—  I search the tide pools for life, what is trapped  in this water-globe, this glass coffin—  and the needlefish flick, end to end.    Spiny sea urchins poke between crags  and the blue crabs bodies’  ombré sea meeting sky.      Those who managed to escape—  mangrove seedpods, headstrong  in their germination, unlaced, split  and ready to take root wherever they land.    A dog watches from his rocky perch:  a school of fish, a patch of silver  shoots, launches, and ricochets.      A fluted cone, a whorled peak,  the green of rusted copper—  the unmarred shells click together in my hand,  canticle of a perfect death.  Bingo #1:  a woman balancing a basket on her head;  pickup truck loaded with entire living room set,  an ox-drawn cart;  family of 3 or more on a motorcycle, extra points if anyone wears helmets or mom rides sidesaddle;  maíz drying by the side of road ;  an open manhole, bonus if there’s a branch propped in front to serve as a warning.    Our Lotería is not El Mariachi, La Chalupa, El Nopal, not the smoke-filled bingo lounge of the Miccousukee Reservation, inky fingers dead set on winning, though the American dollar is our currency, ours is not El Apache, La Pera, El Catrín. For Salvadorans, all days are a Lotería. When we drive past someone laid out on the grass of the median we think 1) is he napping midday? 2) passed out drunk? 3) dead? And all three possibilities are highly likely.     Bingo #2:  a boy on bike shepherding sad-eyed cows;  a Sunday borracho, extra point for an unsheathed machete;  cement eagles or lions on entryway columns;  road kill, bonus if it’s a horse and it’s being picked at by buzzards ;  “Pinchazo” sign painted on a giant truck tire;  muddy trickle of a river, bonus if kids are swimming or women are washing clothes.     At the stoplight will there be fire-eaters or clowns juggling machetes, will the man on the bus look leery or guilty as he slips his hand up the woman’s skirt, is that asphalt smear the body of a stray dog or an old carpet, the boys tapping on the glass huffing paint with strange gold auras around their mouths: window-washers or phone thieves? We know to tuck our real purse under the passenger seat, have the fake one ready to hand over without a whimper. Our faces like the facades of our houses: bars on windows, broken glass embedded into the walls, electrified wires, coils of razor.     Bingo #5:  restaurant and clothing store ads in full English ;  three car washes or three auto-hotels in a row;  shacks bannered with Coca-Cola or Diana signs;  camión loaded with sugarcane, bonus if workers ride on top;  graffiti, only if it’s not related to gangs or political parties;  volcano, extra points if it’s smoking.    We answer these riddles every day: El Hambre, La Navaja, El Machete, La Tortilla. A tablero of 9 chances to fill your board, because when there’s an accident, though a clown in a Cipitio hat was directing traffic, and a car hits a tree—you can be certain Salvadorans will quickly make the most out of that bad turn. For us, luck depends not on guessing, but betting on what we know to be true. Out of nowhere people will come with machetes and dismember the branches, load them in wheelbarrows and cart them off for firewood, a woman will stand by the side of the road, next to the smashed car, pressing her hand to her bright red cheekbone, and seeping through her fingers, the day’s first ¡Lotería!: La Rosa in full bloom. At first it is Beethoven’s Ninth  I’m thinking of, not  all of it, mostly the fourth movement,    that rousing crescendo  you might hear at the end  of a movie where the protagonist    has graduated or overcome  some great hurdle, cello, violin,  then flute, brass, layering    one another, swelling  towards that feeling of triumph  I so rarely seem to have,    but often think about, now  maybe because of the shrieks  and cheers from a party    in the courtyard, drifting into  the window of my room,  where I’m often    alone, laughter  rising like fireworks,  then I’m thinking    of the feeling itself, joy,  how it almost seems made  of air, like you can be full    of it, or sometimes  it’s a child’s red bouncing ball  that somehow gets away    from you, and you have  to chase it into a busy intersection,  and everyone’s laying    on their horns, all that air  vibrating and swollen,  your chest swollen, too,    and maybe chasing it  could get you killed  or crippled at best,    but what feels better  than that moment,  when you catch it,    when it’s yours?  mostly, I hear a phone ringing. Not much else.  Maybe I’d stand at the window more often    if the view were nicer—a lush forest  and a little doe eating red berries from a bush.    Even if she were only there briefly, even if  she never looked at me before leaping off,    it’d be better than this. What brings me here,  usually, is some dish I left out overnight.    (This time it’s a brown and withering  green salad.) But I want to be able to say    that it’s hope that brings me to the window,  that I made too much salad hoping for company.        There’s someone, possibly hurt, missing.    (These planks of wood are proof.)    There’s a hole somewhere.    But that’s only part of the story I pieced    together from bits of shipwreck—    the impenetrable fog, the disfigured    mess, makes meaning of all this.    One black boot was washed up, its laces gone.    Somehow I know to look for the other. I stand    near the sea but can’t see past the fog. Useless.    But still, I look and find, I think, something    silent, and impassable, something the map    could never have predicted.  When you say I am proud of you  it is so locked and loaded. The thing is every day    should be World Suicide Prevention Day  and, for me, it is. Look at me make it, calculate    monthly payments and split chicken between tupperware.  I wash my hair, floss on the go. The mundane feels marvelous    when there’s no quicksand, when there’s no traffic  and I get there with time to spare. Once I had a wood-    paneled basement. More recently, a hallway always  brightly lit as if we didn’t deserve the dark    or already had too much of it. I completed puzzles,  painted myself inside a snowy timber. I learned    Latinate names for green things,  my mindful hands in their dirt. Dear morenita, dominicana,– joven victima. I am sorry you feel out of place.  Join the club.  We live in muscle memory  in these parts. We forget our indigenous names, have to reference Guardian articles to know we are Yaqui, Karankawa, Huichol, Azteca.  I know my Spanish sing song annoys your eardrums. We look simple to you. I told my brothers when they went to your malecón to watch out  for the waves, but they got drunk off all the work, the mamajuana. They send money, but no word.  It’s just that we haven’t seen you before.  You are new here, and didn’t you know?  If you look brown, even black, you Mexican. They’ll treat you like us. Everyone who isn’t white,  in Tejas, en el Norte, is a Mexican. You are as inmigrante as us – Domincan Mexican, Central American Mexican, next to a Pakistani Mexican and they want  us all against the outside of this border wall.  Its ok, we’ll get bullied for you. We’ll try to correct the güeritos when they speak on the news “those Mexicans  bring disease, drugs, they bring terrorists.” I’m not as sophisticated as you. I am from el monte, a rancho, only have a 2nd grade education.  You are fierece,  stubborn, like me, you use a machete, you don’t have guardaespaldas, you have wachimans – your speak is as messed up as mine.  I don’t want to take it away. But I want to know who you are at the root, Taino. We had the same landlord, an Español with awful humor.  He dropped by,  said he needed some things, ransacked the house, infected us all with Smallpox, Spanish y JesuCristo and here we are. Ignorant neighbors, fighting over shorelines,  dancing to different tempos, eating the same rice and beans, breathing the same air. Didn’t you know, every cumbia, corrido where a morena, exists, I think of you?  We can teach one another, look on maps, laugh about dirt floors and blackouts, make up new words – frijoles and abichuelas will be the abijoles we feed ourselves,  hues of flesh, the words from breath, a baby who looks like you and works like me or looks like me and fights like you.  Either way, that baby, every glorious baby  in this world, from now on will be brown. because  i was birthed on time; because i lived in a land of fight, of burnt temples, of street food sizzle, of numbers, of flower language; because i never crawled, i just got up and walked one day; because some feet touched cool earth but kept going; because i see bravery there, communion there, memory there; because i was cradled in colorful arms, raised in humid truths, surrounded by unconditional love; because everyone i always knew is there; because that is when i remember joy, abandon, growing; because i am afraid of forgetting; because i still left; because i am here now, lost but found, stolen but treasured, torn but dual; because i do not have anyone to tell my stories; because i have been reborn; because i live in a space of blanks, of revolution, of multitude, of borrowed things, of hurt; because i am always running; because my feet feel different on this new earth; because i see difference here, religion here, experiment here; because i was taught to settle like oil in clean water, convinced to paint my skin like white canvas, comforted by death and lonely; because i have come to know no one; because this is when i remember nothing; because i want a place where fear is not spilled on the sidewalks like blood, where guns are not synonyms for people, where freedom is more than just a statue; because i want a place to love my daughter, to heal my son, to protect my father, to understand my mom; because i want to live; because i know i can; because i still think of home; because home is in many places; because i ache to go back like addicts need their fix, like books need spine, like heroes need time; because i go but i always come back; because i want this for everyone; because i wrote this for everyone; because we are all  trying; I am six and dressed in  a powder pink & blue organza dress,  made by my soon-to-be madrina.  Mami says, it’s a special day  I will be christened & sprinkled holy.    In this moment I pay no mind  to the tiers of crinoline under my dress  scratching legs flogged by a branch,  a tree switch of fire sparking skin,  daddy’s way of burning the world.    No one notices me as they prepare for the day.  Don Pocho in the backyard pit roasts the cerdo,  Titi Josefa, hair knotted, stirs the arroz con gandules,  hips moving to the lyrics of  Bobby Capo,  Me Importas Tu y Tu playing on the radio.    Daddy, suited up, on the front porch,  sees me & whispers, just this once,  aye que bonita . His words enveloping me,  a moment teeming in sunlight.    I watch him out of the corner of my eye,  songbirds gather in my breath, alight on his smile,  the one I usually see after a shot of Bacardi,  softening his quiet suffering.    I collect this childhood day, save it like a seashell,  lucky stone or a rabbit foot & store it deep  like a blue jay hoarding acorns.  Deep into the marrow of forgiving. If you sign here, no mas  dolor, it takes away the pain, if you don’t,  your baby might die, Maria says  on the PBS documentary, describing the coercion  at the LA County hospital in the seventies.  Women went in to have babies.  They left sterilized.    Afterwards, the night sky scatters grieving women  denied the human right to bear a child,  they are dusted in despair.  The seeds of bloom are shattered  across the American landscape.    In my dream, Maria sits at the river’s edge.  Her baby has sprouted calla lilies on its head.  She snaps one off, uses its turgid spike  to sweep the bottom of the riverbank  for dried up eggs. Her starved alma  drinks the yolks to slake its thirst,  refilling what’s been pillaged from her body.  A shooting star burns the sky with silver rain.    Her case was brought to trial, long overdue.  Spitting blood of unborn babies  the judge proclaimed,  the cultural background of these women  contributed to the problem.    I scream at the news, I slap the choking air,  his words, venom, spewing from a headless snake.  I channel Maria’s stomping foot nailing him down.  Does our language, color or background  make us less valuable, Maria?  No, alma . They had no right.    The calla lily stands for resurrection.  We can blossom once again with grace  bearing any sterile depth.  Years ago, my mother told me  if I wear makeup to bed  when death comes knocking,  I’ll be ready for the date.    I phone her. No answer.  Outside my window, the last  of yellow butter dahlia we planted  stand undimmed.    I drive to her house  against wind whirring its lament.  The grey of day rubs  pencil lead across the sky.    On the road, a window display  of stiff mannequins posing  through a bare canvas stare,  vacant-eyed, in little black dresses.    A sudden longing for café con leche  made with large dollops of milk and sugar,  her color, warm. My need right now.    Hands shaking, I open the door.  Silence smothers me.  I begin to bargain with the universe,  I can be a better daughter .    Her face is loose and make-up free,  unadorned, fixed in a final blank.  She was wrong. So wrong.  A fist catches in my throat. But I have taken off all my clothes and am lean as a strawberry and knots couched in a teachable moment.    For Christ to take up residence, your plate must stay full.    I ate my food. I drank my juice. I rinsed my dishes.    Sometimes all the men go out into the weather until all the roads are impassible and limbs fall off from exposure.    Long suffering is the flood of the matriarchs.    The matriarchs are mighty to save.    The matriarchs are miserable and mad.    Our compassion is in rocks as ore is in rocks.    One wants space from the matriarchs, where space is actually       death.    This is the grace of sacrifice!    When can the matriarchs feel good     about  grace?    Pity the self.    At least we have named our stories “fear” and “isolation.”    Jesus who loves you needs you to eat this, or you will be punished the most.    You’ll wait.    We will wait. I mistook the white iris for a ship. Mistook the dandelion for a bass player. Yes, you always did say I was ungrateful. I mean  bald dandelion. I mean a contrabassoon. I mean I think about who puts the double reed to lips.  You said I was unbelievable and I said a ship isn’t a suspension of belief it is flag-bearing, engineered, resonant. Who makes what.  Elocution, Alice. And selfish, yes, you said that, too. The mistake is not to mistake or not a failure of engineering—is like Julia Child dropping a hen.  I mean a Baptist. I mean a well hole. Do you recall falling in to the rustdark? I do. I do. It was a mirror absence. I mean a bass line.  I mistook not saying so. The run through. There, we’ve dropped the chicken, haven’t we. I mistook  beauty in remembrance of sin. I mean the ship was my fault. I’ll own it. I mean I am from a place. Crow death and buzzard death stood on an Ozark hill, surveying the hollers and treetops beneath the cloak of something darker.  As heavy morning sky pressed down their feathers, they agreed on so little, except this: They should separate.  And away they split to meet the fathers in the cold fields, the unlucky, young, and screeching, and finally the stoically violent parade  of a small town’s widows. I grab a fistful and hurl it at my second grade teacher on her wedding day. Her husband dies in a car crash. I wear a tie-dye shirt that says Gentleness. I bite Ashley after she chooses Milagros as a partner. I eat a stick of butter, try to throw-up. I’m in love with my best friend. He’s known to have crying fits. Runs naked all the time. When I sleep at his house I try not to wet the bed. His father has a banjo with missing strings. My ear is stuffed with cotton as I lie on my side. My brother plays whiffle ball and wheezes. My father drinks seven cups of coffee a day. His hands shake. Macho meows and meows. A deep, melodic sound. He’s my feline hero. I have many names: Penelope, Kelly, Abigail. None of them close to my real one. It’s years before my first wine cooler, before doing The Wop in the school cafeteria, before bleached hair and razors, stain between my legs. My mother’s thumbs twitch as she holds me in her lap. She has blue, protruding veins like swollen rivers. I scratch myself, pull my own hair, imagine troops storming the streets outside the library. I’m never safe. There’s a shadow in my spleen. Tiny red bugs swarm the window screen. My brother and I watch two men slug it out, drunk and ill-coordinated. One of them starts to bleed. Rosie, Carmen and Tiana follow me to Ashley’s stoop and, hands on hips, chant, Flat Leaver, Flat Leaver, Flat Leaver. I leave everyone flat. Ashamed of my breath, smell, cells. Wearing a cast that cuts off my circulation. My parents don’t notice till my grandmother grabs my arm and says, Que línda, how chubby she is. We’re in the Bronx at her house with the chatchka-filled cabinets and plastic-covered sofas. My father grabs a scissor, begins cutting. It’s the season of peaches and beatings on the beach. A man and woman lying flat, hands behind their backs, cuffed by Police. It’s the season of hunting: the people are brown, face down in the sand. Cooler of soda and beer. It’s the season of tight-chest, of Will this ever end, of aching for my friends. I have a constant fear of rape. When I was fifteen we went to Brighton 7. Janet and Rue wore bikinis, I wore a polka-dot one piece. A fight broke out, with thirty or more. That was the summer boys were pulling off girl’s tops chanting, WHOOP THERE IT IS! It happened everywhere. On the street, at the beach, at the Red Hook pool. We snuck in one night, climbed the gate after hours. When I saw the man and woman on the ground, my whole body asked why. But it was more like my lips parting with no sound. in America the great, i don’t wear  a deer loin cloth to cover my manhood,  i’m forced to wear an orange striped jumpsuit  to cover my bones as they believe me dangerous,    sometimes, i walk alone & naked  wearing my black, spotted skin  with a sign that reads, “shoot me,”  tied across my chest,    i’ve grown old & tired pacing  back & forth, i’m caged  in the smallest jail cell in America,    i’ve travelled across empty fields,  i’ve crossed el desierto on top of La Bestia,  i’ve been locked up in a jail cell in Texas,  or in some room in Yuba County,    even though my name is Cuauhtémoc,  in a hot & dusty room in Florence Arizona,  the INS judge calls me Jose or Joaquin,  when he denies me to stay here in America,    i’m shackled to another man,  his skin is darker, he’s old & tired,  he’s covered with scars from head to toe,  we hobble together down the hallway,  a long & cold chain is tied around our black necks,    i’m always throwing chingadazos,  one, two & three strikes & i’m out,  one more fight & they’ll put me away for life,  i’m always a bullet away from death,    i’m shackled against the metal fence,  i’m tasered, shot at & spit on,  i’m told over & over  i’m worth una chingada,    in my jail cell, i breathe the stench of gun  fire & burnt meat as i pull the bullet  shrapnel lodged in my hermanos’ corazones,  i have a full jar of bullet shrapnel as proof. You knew how to make nothing of your leaving:  your brother’s baseball glove grease slicked on the hinges,  how to shape your bed to look like your curled body, slipping  out onto the small stage of night. You said you’d meet him,  the tide was low, and he was waiting for you  with a bottle of vodka.    This was the summer you took to running and wheezed  your way to the edge of town stopped-stark by the bay,  the ocean, the interstate. He told you things you already knew  about the stars, how the light was old,    and you cooed in surprise anyway; the bottle stuck  in the sand between you, as quiet as a chess piece.  Your hips were new so you gave yourself a new name,  said you were born somewhere else, smiled, lied  about your age, lied about––    When you wake it’s morning. Alone and half  in the tide, your panties rough with a handful  of sand. Salt crusting your eyelashes shut, your hair is the same  color as the shoreline. With one purpled wrist, there is a hollow  ache in you, like something’s    gone.  As you rise, the seagulls startle, shocked by your living.  Wings springing away from the driftwood. This morning  is strung together. You stumble home. And it’s different    after that. And by that I mean, it’s no longer a lie to say yes  when your father asks if you remember that one time  when a tiger shark washed ashore. How it was stiff on the sand  and everyone stood in a circle around it. How you,  three years old, slinked through the crowd, toddled over  to the dead thing, kissed it on its nose. In the morning, I dissected the face  of a rose. The flayed petals fell apart    like honesty. Out of its flesh  grew obsidian and basalt and all    the dark trauma of the earth.  I asked of the rose and it opened.    I kept its red in jars on my dresser.  In the morning, a stone black crow    cawed to me from the cleaved branches  of the dogwood. I knew rawness,    and I thought of you, figure formed  in the stain of color. I was the crow    and you were a tree of roses. August ends like a zipper  on my suitcase, locked with an ornate  key inscribed with the initials  of the woman whose curved figure  shines like Jupiter in twilight.  Inside the suitcase, stars.    Stars stored in sippy cups  milk for the baby, for the son  of the moon  woman, some goddess  of harvest, of autumnal swing-  sets, with puddles of wet  leaves on their leather seats &  early darkness oils their chains.    The coffee pools in my mug, un-  finished like the season will never be;  winter is certain  as the tide, & it rises  to my lips, warm, but pulls  away.    I stand here at the shore-  line, heels in the water,  & industry rises, breaking  the innocent horizon. I wish  for gears as organs.    An immigrant in steamboat,  boy in transition, I  listen to the radio in the bowels  of the ship’s hold, sick  as the crescent’s pocked skin.    The captain announces the sky.  It is clear: the woman  has let go of her baby. The stars  are brighter, but silent.  The boy doesn’t coo in the night. 1.  What I fear most: the burning  sky, never being able to speak    again. The sharp, inimitable voicelessness  of the swallow that knows    she is already dead.    2.  Once, a boy told me  he wanted to write a long poem  about rivers.    Is that what this is? In the cemetery    a child laughs his way around  the mausoleum,    calling to his little sister  He’s dead.  Come on.    3.  Wrap me in tape    and throw me in the river.  I’ll end up in the place  where chrysanthemums grow    out of fox skulls.    Name the bones  for the petals.  Call them Eliza, rain,    teeth. I’ll call it heaven.    4.  In the night, I tear  off my name, skinnydip    in this wine-dark city I never wanted  to call home,    far from my family. I could build  my life here. I could be dead    here. Naked, nameless,    no one knows who I am  anyway. Two wolves  hunt in the dark, and I    am more of an animal, primal instinct  for survival.    I put my name back on.    5.  Now, the river. A riddle.  Is that what this is?  Mixed-up understandings of why    my arms fall into the water.    I am losing myself, thumbs first.  I want to feed the water my body, to be    bodiless. The act of leaving  is graceful, primal, it has become    mine. The river    is always going somewhere. I am always  going.    6.  Thick light, the kind  to fall in love to. The right kind of song    on the FM radio, a song that can stand up    and build a barn  in the middle of the prairie, canvas    for teenage vandalism, can build summer  while it’s there too. A girl draws    her life complete, charcoal sketches  and broken wheat.  The song, a funeral march.    7.  Am I imagining  life or death, refractions  of each other?    These are my versions of heaven.    The river never ends, it bends  and bends until it breaks  into ocean.    He’s dead.    Come on .  Stop writing about this.    8.  A portrait. When the sun falls to the earth,    the pines catch fire  and the whole cemetery burns.  Name it sunset.    I am there. I am here, in this poem,  unapologetic dynamism  of water, I will not burn.    Let me be a force of nature.    Let me never die.  Wild animal, and powerless, and magnificently  continuing. I will sculpt the land    around me. I will bend and bend  and break  into the ocean. Leave me the mix tapes, please. They’re the best of you.  But take the television. It’s contaminated by WWF.  I remember you staying up nights putting those sounds together just to please me.  But then I have this image of your proxy behemoth, growling and grunting, muscles amplified by steroids, pounding some look-a-like into the mat.  I’ve always been practical. You have a bad habit of over-leaning on others.  So I keep the micro-wave. You go back home with your grandmother’s prize dishes between your legs.  It’s my first genuine breakup with a guy. It’s not a question of who owns what. But what owns you. What owns me. Mother said a lady is always clean, well-dressed, and presentable, even when dying inside.  Dr. Tim looked me up and down with undisguised approval.  I’d finally washed my hair, and it hung in loose waves down my back.  I’d put on the size 0 mini-dress with lace sleeves (to show off my legs and hide the needle tracks).  Sliding my feet into a pair of high heels felt right for the first time in ages.  I’d slipped my wedding ring onto a chain, clipped it around my neck.  I’d drunk black coffee, forced down an apple, then thrown it up in the sink,  put a coat on and looked less anorexic.  In the waiting room I’d read Vogue’s Fall issue, cover to cover.  Today I was as beautiful as any model.  Dr. Tim checked me up and down. With my new look, the shrink hardly knew me.  I fingered the razor blade in my pocket.  Dr. Tim ushered me inside. “You look like a million bucks.”        When the date ends, your sister will kiss the fullback goodnight on tip toe under the porch light, her soft curls a halo illuminating her naiveté.  You, on the other hand, will stare at your bare feet. Not shy: Sullied. Seething.  Your sister will thank the fullback for dinner at Tony’s on the Pier, the copious cocktails and signature chocolate mousse. She’ll tell him she had a wonderful time. That she hopes she’ll see him again.  You will say none of these things. You will mind your manners. You will try not to think how the quarterback just forced himself into your mouth.  You will bite your tongue and smile, pretend his baller body hasn’t just slammed into yours, that he didn’t wipe his penis on your sheets when he was done,  that while he was assaulting you, you didn’t wonder if the fullback was out there, raping your sister. If he, too, was brutal.  In fact, your sister and the fullback only watched tv, making out, but just a little.  You had no way to know this.  You lie there and take it for your sister. You think about her delicate spine, believing if you play it wrong, he might snap her like a sparrow.  They eye the closed door of your bedroom. They share a knowing smile.  They know nothing. The river is not a road so is an invitation  for the mind to roam the spaces between    cities where mines still pine like bulbs  for a springtime-worth of weight.    Don’t all seeds long to blossom  their coiled code? Even the dead    don’t know how to stay  closed, worming as they do, rooting    as they do. Leafing new  into the same sweet light.    The river reveals nothing  of where things vanish to,    only the ghost-pool  of my own gaze.    This date knives  right through, passes    like any other day. My body changes,  but less vividly. I can only call it healing.    I can only heal, as the battlefields  this river feeds do, scabbing green    over the soldier graves, the child graves,  there is nothing it can’t stomach    into fuel. It should be easy to stomach  loss the size of a walnut,    an apricot, when there are more atoms  in my body than stars    in the known universe. I don’t know  if we are the reflection    or if God refracts nightly into stars  to shame us. Either way, we’re mostly space    and survival. We can only stay dead  a little while, before green muscles in    to wake us. Evening, slick-tongued, ties up the night like a cherry stem, promise  of rain shuddering a few aimless stars. The moon gilds into a relic    of older nights, opulent with throne and spice, gutter-scents enslaved  in aristocratic kitchens. An ancient pungence leaches longing    from new mouths. These are the alleys where men pay for touch.  Too measured to call it pleasure, that methodical stoking of skin    into its own cold smolder. A bill slides across a lacquered table  and a girl drops the silk of herself to the knees of yet another    expat king. In another city I once took a job as a bar masseuse,  so I too have taken payment for my hands, stroked CEO’s    and brokers into those most intimate sounds a body makes  when the mind tunes out. I’ve been that girl lighting the night    with the lamp of her throat, a glow that says  what you want I can give you and why is it a trick    that there’s a cost? Both a little lost, Gypsy and I traipsed  Kensington’s crown of fashionable bars, rubbing the shoulders    of London’s workhard/playhard crowd in the popsicle glow  of glass-blown cocktails. We were taught the language of refusal    comes more naturally than yes, so we pressed our hips a bit  against their backs when we promised to relieve their stress.    I remember the night Gypsy puked all over an Italian suit,  confessed she was pregnant and wouldn’t keep it. Trellis-frail,    her dress seemed afraid to touch her skin. She curled into a booth  to rest and I kept massaging necks. I always got the biggest tips    when I squeezed that chaste stalk of flesh so gentle it began to feel  like loneliness. Beyond Dong Khoi, far below the storied rooftop    bars of the Carravelle, the Continental, from every doorway  someone casts a line old as trade. Don’t we all call out constantly    from the porch of ourselves? I’ve crammed in a subway car,  breasts silently filling with milk. I’ve held a man I had no plans    to love, a single egg hovering inside me, calling in the only way it can,  animal musk snared in my hair, blood blushed close as possible to where    I ended and he began. Waiting. Exposed. The night Gypsy didn’t show  I worked alone, pretending I was glad I didn’t have to compete for tips.    It was only later, when our boss called to say she’d hung herself  from a tree in Hampstead Heath, that I remembered finding her in the alley    outside the bar. She was smashing french-fries into a smear of ketchup  like snuffing out cigarette after cigarette. There was something dead    about her then, but I was screaming too loudly to hear her. “Women make poems? Burn them, burn them,  Let them make bone-lace, let them make bone-lace. . . .”    —Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 1662     I have much of the martyr, would set myself afire  if I wasn’t raised by a woman born two centuries ago.   My ribs would form a cathedral’s arch  above my dark hair,  fingers each would tremble,  if she hadn’t been born two centuries ago.       “Martyr” — from the Greek mártys , to “witness”      The legend of Griselda speaks of the daughter of a poor man, a sickly man, who kept them alive by the spinning of wool. A marquis noticed her “virtuous habits,” “sober behavior,” and made her his wife. He spends twelve years tormenting her with concocted tests: Tells her their daughter must be killed as she’s low-born, the same for their son. Sends Griselda bareheaded, barefoot, and naked, except for a slip, back to her father. The story goes she never lost her cool. Time passes and Mr. Marquis sends for Griselda to make arrangements for a new young bride. Of course the bride is the daughter-not-killed accompanied by her brother-not-killed and Mr. Marquis loves grateful Griselda for her obedience and all her affection. Bullshit. He’s smoke-char and asbestos robed, burnt down by some long winter psychosis.       Once, in the small kitchen of my mother’s small house,  my then-husband disliked his spaghetti so much he pitched a fork   to the back of my thigh and it stuck.. Angels visited the nights I hid  behind trees across the street. I watched like a wet dog in the rain as her master moves through a dry house.  It’s hard to explain why I stayed so long.      “Witness” — from witnes as in knowledge    In 1650, near Oxford, Anne Greene was hung for murdering her newborn child. She’d biblically known her employer’s (Sir Something) grandson but not of her pregnancy. Still accused she was of murder though the thing (a boy-child?) was not over a span; just clump of clotted matter passed dead in the house of office. On December 14 th in a cold rain she swayed with the noose ‘round her slim neck. Witnesses thumped her breast, pulled her legs, and jerked her forearms to be sure she was dead. Later when physicians bent to dissect her she breathed. Convinced she was forgiven by God they revived her and a spectacle was born. Her suffering tale and noose-mark folks paid a small fee for. They asked if she recalled anything angelical while she hung dead. Death wrote her martyr, granted her fame, but a witness made her not.      My son and I crouched in a back-bedroom closet  as his father cranked  Seeger’s “Hollywood Nights” as homage to an ex-fiancée  who left him in 1975 for Hermosa Beach.   She was blond with a straight-toothed smile  while mine are the crooked teeth of a mother born almost a century ago.    “Husband” — from the Middle English husbonde , frugal manager, master of a house    Elvina Apperson Fellows’s first husband was a cook named Julius. In 1851 they married; she fourteen, he forty-four. Oregon pioneer-wifedom, Elvira wrote, could be equated with slavery of Negroes in the South . Drunk most of the time and when drunk, often wanted to kill her. He used to beat me until I thought I couldn’t stand it. One night she hid in her mother’s house, like I hid behind trees in the yard, and he took out a pistol and shot through the window. The bullet passed over her head; out of fright from shattered glass she dropped to the floor. Julius thinks she is dead as next he put the pistol’s barrel into his mouth, pulled the trigger and I was a widow.     “Martyrize” —  a transitive verb — expresses a doable activity  like “flee,” “cheat,” or “leave.”   In the last century I left my husband and son.  I’d like to think it was sacrifice.  I tell myself it’s a martyr I am when I hear the solemn bark   of birds under a coal-stricken sky—but it’s Anne Greene crying out   I am loose from God, I am loose from God. the smell of brass smoldering in his  sleep  he woke to the fire of the parade  grabbed his horn  & took aim at Shamarr  out the window of his room  with one hand  Pop lifted me up by the nape of my neck for walking in front of a lady  painted & open at Zulu  like the lion cub i donned  he placed me back into the pride of the beat  wrapped in neverending notes  for death & for spring  for the fattening before Lent  from the wishes of Pans & princesses bouncing free  til the brain bursts  inside tell me what you see  a lucid second line still possible to ride  it’s how you enter    walk into any shop on Magazine  the sweet what you need, shas [1] pour  to ease the sting of sugar cane  the sweet what you need, shas  for the ease of the whole city in one big boat  gliding in with all the saints    we’re in Butler’s:  a shack losing its roof in the black pearl  my cousin waving defiant in the middle of the dance floor  oblivious to every shoulder leaning his way  matching Ice Cube, MC Ren, Dr. Dre, & Easy-E line for line  in perfect flow  Fuck tha Police [2]  searching for yey  from strangers  finally a dread with gold teeth offers  if he’ll give him cash first  waiting outside for gilded snakes to return  i tell my cousin he’s never coming back  he has to he tells me  he can’t stay in that busted shanty all night  people must go back to where they’re from  it’s how the world works  & if he doesn’t have the coke  i’ll trip him when he tries to run  like his feet are cosmic magnets    we pull all American music & spirits south to the toes of the boot  like water down the drain of a bathtub  we’re the center of the spiral  we reverse & hurricane it all through the other cities & towns  the lands dry & calm before us  be grateful  without us America would have no music & no spirits  absinthe from the Old Absinthe House in the alley  the sugar cube aflame in the green  repeating ghosts beating a blue drum clean of its air  line for line  in perfect polyrhythm  each syncopation leaning back off the pulse right where it needs to lie  we’re the first American town to measure time by storms  my uncle’s throw from the float still until we chose to blink again  then the beads rushed our faces & necks  my uncle’s throw from the float still until we remembered motion  then the doubloons bouncing off our teeth  we could still be there  no eyelids, no gravity  my cousin & i  ecstasy at high tide  perched on the drum colors of the parade    sailing the winds of Carnival season  after Brees threaded a holy sphere through the cover two  into two praying palms  to Stills  to still the wailing  for one Sunday all the churches stopped shaking  after 22 intercepted our city’s lost son & took him home  then we knew we’d be marching in    but are we gonna get there with our bodies?  maybe not  but we need our legs, our feet to second line    we need our mouths, our lips to consume  to wake to freedom from Rose’s [3] chicory café au lait  to burn for blackened cocodril from the grill  cooled by alligator pears stuffed with crab meat    Pere whispering the reign of his grandfather Isaac Newton Marks  my third great  king of rex  embers threatening the throne suspended with song over the streetcar rails run parallel, never touch  leading the unification movement:  tinder merging with wind  waiting for a spark to carry    my hometown is one fire after another  street taken over & falling apart    give in to the ghost dance  ghost dance  give in to the ghost  ghost the dance  dance the ghost  ghost give in  to the ghost  dance  into the ghost dance    Denis formed from Dionysius in the veins of family trees  taken from behind by the African gods  we drink on every corner ‘til they’re goddesses  my aunt is slurring my name again at Bacchus  & i know my response will just be spilled  wine on the riverbarge  staining the poque [4] chips with my fingers’ want  i put my life on the line  before the turn  into a new king’s death  what does his funeral sound like?

An escape with no clues left behind. Slang. Obsolete. Like Amelia over the Pacific, Barbara into a December night  We need lost women like ancients needed fire—hot coals carried in chaga mushrooms to burn slowly without flaming or going out. We live dutifully among the living. We only carry enough hot ashes to smoke our rooms in incense. Yet the smell of us is stronger than prayer.

She’s a woman we’ve never heard of destined to be the Next Great American Writer. By the time she’s fourteen, she’s published two books and written countless poems. Her 1927 debut novel, A House Without Windows (lonely girl runs away to live in the wild as a wood nymph) receives glowing reviews from the New York Times and H.L. Mencken is congratulating her parents for raising her.  Voice-overs and avatars. Everybody loves a child genius. At 13 she works as a deck hand aboard a lumber schooner from New Haven to Nova Scotia researching her second book, The Voyage of the Norman D . More praiseful reviews. Society has a taste for the untimely success, but what is extraordinary? Living up to destiny or suffering it?    What’s left  Her father leaves for another woman. With typewriters and little else, mother and daughter embark on an open-ended trip: Barbados to Panama, Tahiti to Tonga, Samoa to Hawaii. After a year, her mother leaves her with a guardian, but she flees to a hotel in San Francisco to write poetry. She is still famous at 15. A contemporaneous Los Angeles  Times headline reads: Child Writer In Revolt.  Here we reach the core of the problem: will she be a she, or will she be an I? Third person limited or first person singular? What is a person? According to the Oxford Dictionary: A human being regarded as an individual : She is a person of grit and depth; legally, an unspecified individual : The hotel rate is $2.50 per night per person; in singular with modifier, an individual characterized by a preference or liking for a specific thing: She is a wilderness person; an individual’s body : Detectives who catch her trying to escape out the hotel window note she has money on her person; a character in a play : Her role in the person of a notorious girl on the run. Origin of person: Middle English: from Old French persone , from Latin persona , ‘actor’s mask.’ What kind of play is she in, “finished by a death” or “ended by a marriage?” Words that rhyme with person: worsen.    Jammed, messy, dim  Because it’s the Depression and she needs money. Because she’s a woman. Because she’s a writer. Because her editor father is no longer guiding her work into the hands of publishers. Because she falls in love. Because she travels, this time to Europe, this time with a man. Because she marries. Because she wants more, and also nothing more, than to be outside. Because all writing is in sand.  She pulls her life closer to examine it; it blanches, then bruises under the pressure of her thumbs. Becalmed might describe the final months of her known life. Pick a side—ringside, wayside, blindside.  December 7, 1939, after an argument with her husband, she walks out with $30 and a notebook and is never seen or heard from again. She is 25.  Her life plays like a film short with a stunning opening and a stolen reel.  Her life reads like wrack lines—tides’ debris—eelgrass, gull tracks, foam. The goat genitals cooked beneath  the sun, losing their pinkness    after two days. One man pissed  on them on his way to prayer without    thinking about the body they used  to hang on. Two naked kids    poked at the rotting thing,  the flesh tore and excreted    nothing. The meat soaked in  the basin in its own sinkside    bloom and gloom. Suffocate a fish, then choke  on its bone. For days, you practice    the Arabic letters. Your father spits  while your mother perfumes    below her chin. Remember the place  of the moles, and remember to rinse    the steel full of phlegm. Knife  the goat like this, and hold    chickens between your thumb  and index. Begin to love    at his jaw.  where does grief live    welled at the hips	      wrapping around your gut	      inside your skin	      on its surface  pouring out  an umbrella after the rainstorm	      you without an umbrella  between fingers the skin chalky	      your worries a rosary the slip		      of each prayer  thumb to forefinger  your fingers against your forehead	      against your heart	      each shoulder in turn  a cross on your lips  nestled in your throat		      a ball rolling back from your mouth		      gathering snow  growing	      hitches in your chest		      melts in the acid of your stomach  you shiver to release it       when i was two my Baba broke his shoulder  so he took a vacation from sixteen hour days  on the store floor and we flew to the ‘iblad  just me and my Dad  in a yellow taxi cab  from the airport in Amman  i was so cold in the back seat Baba in front  he covered me with the first thing he could find  a nightgown from our suitcase    at my uncle’s house i dance and sing  in a red dress with white dots  my hair is curt around my tiny face  i didn’t get fat until i was eight  everyone just loves this girl  who can sing all the folk songs  i am Baba’s girl through and through  so much that i won’t sleep unless he is near me    tonight i sat at the table with my Baba  and we sang sakkar ma’mal il sukkar  my jam when I was two  we sang with accompaniment  the crackling grill and cackling sisters and careening kids  my mother laughing laughing at old jokes  on land that used to be an Israeli army camp  in the outskirts of Beit Sahour  we can still see the watchtower looming over “Area C”  but tonight “C” is for “cover me”  which i do when Baba gets cold  in the cool air of ‘Ush ‘Ghrab  and now he’s in the next room sleeping  because hamdillah outside our love  i cannot rest. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious complication of diabetes that occurs when your body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones. One symptom is fruity smelling breath.    i.    my mother tells me the pieces like statistics  at 3 she could pour  orange juice  at 5 she could rub icing  across my grandmother’s gums  details memorized  to keep her mother alive    i want to hold that girl  but she’s gone sugar dissolved in water    ii.    a friend tells me  how she saved a stranger  knowing their condition  by that sweet scent    i ask too many questions what did it smell like?  like too much icing? or souring food?    i listen to every word hungry for similes  of icing and resurrection    iii.    on a winter morning  the siren wails  reminding my mother  of all the times she wondered  if this time  it would take her mother    even now my heart races  terrified of love  slipping through  her elegant hands    iv.    my friend’s mother was a diabetic  what a difference 15 years makes  between a childhood  of orange juice  or insulin    v.    the smell must be  like the trash  i piled into a dying van    so strong it wooed  black bears to scavenge  in the sunlight    i can’t forget the scent  so sweet it soured  the tongue    vi.    in the silence following dreams  i can smell it  that sweet smell  between death  and resurrection. The trouble is, everything calls to me.  The peacock with the red eye glares her knowing. The red fletch of the sandhill crane rises like a flag in an unknown field. The hummingbird grows large, dances emerald infinity.  The wolf pursues the bear, splits the shadow of pine and flashes yellow teeth—and I do not turn away, pursued by my own violent reverence.  I dream of oceans and sink to their center, into perfect squares of coral reef. I become an oyster at work on a precious secret. When I surface, I gleam.  I could make the horizon pulse, with just the turn of my head.  I wake up with other languages in my mouth: acer negundo, acer negundo.  With strange collaborations in my throat: magpied fields, magpied fields.  And I swallow every one.  Do not wake up next to me, whispering: Too much, too much.  Never say it is too much.  Tell me it is only human— to wish for someone to believe in the myth of you. His legs then, a clock too fast, too easy in telling me how small the space we take up, how far we manage  to wander off still. Any time away from home is too long. Pomona has changed—is now a man asking if I want to buy  his MP3 player. He raises an earbud for me to listen, tells me no one believes him, but he doesn’t say about what;  it’s how they say yes, but don’t look. I only nod. Despite me, he talks about his daughter who works at AutoZone and is  the manager now—the jefe. But his son, who I’m certain I went to school with, who walked into 5th grade one morning  with his eyebrows shaved and sat down without saying a word, who never spoke to anyone ever again, he does not mention.  Not even once. Where have all my classmates gone? Where I grew up has nowhere to live, but he says  he’ll be alright, he’ll be alright. He’ll be alright, cuz the lady from the next block owes him money  for cutting her grass. And have I seen a Bible around? No one’s going to pick it up, he says, not unless it had  a hundred dollars in it—that would be something, wouldn’t it? He’s nodding, he’s balancing himself  on the bike. He’s trying to leave, but will I be here tomorrow? He might be around; my town is always around.  So how about that MP3? I can keep it if I want—no, how about for ten bucks? My town is presenting  its calloused palm. Now my town unrelenting pedaling like everything is alright, like everything is alright,  like a Ferris Wheel no one wants to ride, that stays spinning beside the operator who calls us to step on up,  scooping cups of air, one handful at a time. The day comes unannounced, inexplicable,  when you can no longer assemble your face    into a blue-&-white bouquet,  color diffusion creating the illusion of light.    The day comes when the illusion of light  is not enough    to sustain a house of cards, a score of men,  a girl going in & out of the yellow field.    Islands float in milk, magma: volcanic rock  I need you     to sharpen into something    that can cut food  or kill me. I do believe it makes sense, bee,  a kind I am too far away to see.    You understand. What will save us is a thing  with stitches, stored in the dark. The land marches on  in just one direction, but how can I follow it    without feet.     How can I hold it without hands. You’re pregnant with your third daughter.  I see the baby bump on social media,  followed by posts about how protests are  unpatriotic, how women have lost no rights  yet. You’re a good mother. I can tell  by the pictures of your two girls, golden-haired  and napping, smiles sappy with sleep.  Their bodies chose such an open posture  to plop down on those couch cushions,  and you are to thank for their sense of safety.  I type a timid response, ask if his comments  about snatching women without consent  encourage assault? You tell me that’s ridiculous.  I’m entitled to an opinion, but that’s absurd.  I wonder about the first girl he ever grabbed,  what color her eyes are. If her favorite animal  is a bird, or could ever be again.  Your two girls are sleeping on the couch,  and you’re pregnant with your third. where are you from  so what, if I never saw you— in the beginning, life was blind   what is that accent  my notion of style is to be expelled with vogue eyebrows while I pull taut around my lips a sotto voce  define sentimentality  four sparrows picking pebbles on snow-robed garbage no, no—the burnt baby flickering on TV  who are your ancestors  a vase filled with grenade pins  when was the last time you cried  I saw a nondescript clay house in Rogue One and wept for hours  do you remember the first time you cried  once, as a child, I climbed a hill and arrived, I swear, inside you—everything morphed red—but the Shah of afternoon disciplined me by my sea-black mane—it was then that you happened  please describe exile in one sentence  I am a wife of fire  what do you know about fire  sometimes I awake marrowless, bone-hungry and expose my clavicle—first bone to ossify—to the dirty light of the empire  have you ever been to Afghanistan  yes—no, but let us not converse about the obvious—  when did you learn English  still, I’m half-ashamed— is it right to call me yours? I language about our kinship  where are you from  I was outgassed, I was conditioned to orbit America (for too long, my answer was a fiction)  what is beauty in your country  I check my eyeliner in stranger’s cars and barbarous bugs blink back at me from the warp of wing mirrors until I stab them  where are you from  (the sunburnt otherwhere of my face is yours). I am ashamed to be moved so by your soot and sundried tarmac, the way you halt the hefty skin staring back at me. Or how you brush livid hours from my salt-streaked hair as I pick bugs from the swab of sweat between my breasts, then crush exoskeletons to the rhythm of my learned breath—in, out, in, atomic listening to the blood pump whispering yes, I am that I am, but I am also fearful as a flea trapped in a dark blue balloon—my armor, my parasitic glow unspent. Tree branches break under the weight of a hand while ants bloom like stains on a kitchen towel. What if, in this life, I can’t build anything that won’t be touched? The Rubaiyat says let go:  Tamam shud . Thusly I slip out of the window, scatter my eyelashes with the bug dust on the grass that, all these years, didn’t ask why. The ambulance puncturing the distance screeches in or out, in or out. Even if I tried to give up, my body always wants to give in to this agreeable moaning on. I take off my pants to lie down in the mud. Sometimes, the ink laps me up. Other times, hornets carry their houses around me in silent colonies, piss glistening from wings until their precise absences swarm me shut. The term light-skinned refers not to color but weight when measured on the scale of prestige. To explain how gravity can both pull up and pull down those of ambiguous origin, this course will approach physics through an analysis of chemistry and the body. How fair complexions burn yet revert to their original state. How the original state consists of multiple states. How light enables the subject to pass through doors otherwise closed, making restrictions windows into the minds of the gatekeeper. Mulatto, mongrel, mutt,— having already mastered such terminology, students are expected to be able to differentiate between people and animal in a category of Jeopardy entitled Husband or Husbandry . While designing protocol for naming future elements, consideration will be given to credit all parties involved in their creation, as complex elements struggle to be defined in the black and white logic of the past. No physics course is complete without attention to laws—Albert Einstein’s, Edward Murphy’s, Jim Crow’s; all are subject to being explored in an attempt to determine how many drops it takes to form an identity, and if only one, then which. My first step towards adulthood came in middle school,  a copy of The Hobbit wrapped under the tree. Try to finish by dinner, Dad said. I didn’t. How could I have known his prescience at the time? The joke this was no volume to devour in one sitting harbored a scab I had yet to peel. Up to then, a day made work of R. L. Stine fast enough to grow a bookshelf by summer. Barely a dent in my new ride, I gave up after an hour, returned to the controller and screen that blended late December afternoons. Not everything can be escaped; Dad came up and waited for me to die three times. I’d beat it later, he said, had already left when I’d turned around to find the book silent on my bed like a Masterlock, waiting for my hand to crack open again and again, one page turned at a time. Attention…Evacuate Your Cities U.S. leaflets, 1945 (Paul Ham)  Before the bomb, it was a punishable offense to pick up warnings Americans dropped on Nagasaki. The flyers soaked in still water, floated down the river with cracked branches, their leaves green.  Handouts swept along iron grate fences, unread in schoolyards. Only authorities could lift the words to their eyes and see the script before the act played out again. ‘Hiroshima’ came from ‘generous’ before it became the benevolence of a bully mailing an invite to the flag pole. A sky that gives manna gives death notice, wind scraping the papers along boulevards as if they had missed trash cans. It had the sound of dragging a rake across a field to be sown. How easy to be taken as signs of life; left face down on the asphalt, the word ‘evacuate’ means stay. Washing machine tousles dirty clothes, suds  searching for cleanliness. Dryer sheets scent  the air. Mom and auntie fold clothes of strangers  for $2 an hour. Disco plays on a transistor radio  outside the bubble-gum store next door. A man  smoking a cigar walks past the Laundromat.  He grabs my ponytail. My follicles cry. He keeps  pulling as if he’ll take me to the edge, drop me  into the void of his face. My neck strains  past my ear. Ponytail that reaches my tailbone  smells of charcoal, his wrinkled hands. A big  black hat atop a face with no nose or mouth.  Why would he take me? Where is my mother?  It is daylight and there are so many people  on the sidewalk. As he reaches the edge  of a tar-stained sidewalk, he lets go. Just like that,  no reason for taking me, no reason for letting go.  As I enter the Laundromat, a girl sits on the side-  walk and takes a piece of freshly thrown Bazooka  bubble-gum off the concrete, into her mouth. I tell  mom and auntie as they fold just bleached cotton  undershirts not even looking at me. They laugh  and say, “What man? You’re fine Sonia. You’re fine!”  After all, I am still here. They keep folding underwear.    On the radio, the music stops playing in the middle  of a Jackson 5 song. A man says the war is over  and our men are leaving a place called SighGone.  When they come back who will believe them?  I.  A girl of eight skips around the veranda, a gecko on the ceiling taunting her. Wonders if the chipkali will fall on her father as he sleeps. Or will it slurp a mosquito.  The ceiling fan gives her frock a lift, a breeze when nothing else moves, only father’s eyes fluttering behind eyelids. Dev wears a subtle smile  a hint of happy, just at the edge of his lips. He has shut out the world of grocery shopping, job hunting, wife pleasing. Was there joy spilling out from dreams?  The girl wonders. Maybe he was dancing in a Bollywood film with Zeenat Aman, as she shimmied her waist side to side, carrying a clay urn on her head.  His foot dangles from the roped manji as sunlight streams through an iron gate, before that a lemon tree, before that the chameli , before that the green  card, filed neatly in his wallet, along- side his Two Guys credit card.   II.  She wonders why he’d leave mangoes and mammas with love spilling from their dupatted bosoms.  She wonders why he’d leave behind zippy scooters  and street vendors selling gol guppay overflowing with tamarind and potatoes. And come to barren, grey, winter steel in the sky?   III.  She skips away when the fan stops whirling, no electricity from 2-4pm. Mumma is inside, rummaging this’s and that’s: the nose ring she wore  at her wedding, old coins with holes in them, the kind used before India split into three, father’s old college yearbook.  She thumbs pages  till she finds, “Atam Dev does not follow the old ways. He is very modern, and especially loves American music.” Above the caption is a photo of a young  Sikh man, turbaned, skinny pants, doing the Twist, arms outstretched, hips in mid-sway.  “Wake up daddy, you cannot hide any more.”  The chipkali unspools its tongue, nabs its prey. I have traveled long to inhabit your Casa Azul .  I walk through your corridors.  I step outside and make my hands sore  to cut the landscape, bring it back indoors,  and set it on the easel as you like best.    Everything here is enormous. Objects fill the space.  A huge papier-mâché skeleton sleeps soundly on the canopy  of your bed, los xoloitzcuintles and your pet deer Granizo  walk undisturbed, the Aztec gods guard over all.    You filled Diego’s room with a thorn necklace  so big it will entangle him.  I plunge into your crowded bathtub, amid volcanoes  and floating dresses. I emerge renewed. A giantess.    I walk back to your room. You are not there.  I read the note you left me:  “ Me entenderás, cuando te duela  el alma como a mi . ”  You poured vino tinto in a glass. I drink it lavishly.  My body is so dark now and a new whiteness tints the sky.  I stood beside you while you held your phone at arms’ length.  On that day, strangely, the cancer that was wresting you away from me and over to the other side in invisible increments of hours and days was also allowing you one good day, or at least most of one, and you loved cloudy skies and freakish weather.  How you loved them.  It was that afternoon, as I stood by your side in the threshold of our front door, watching you as you watched and filmed the loud and sudden hailstorm pounding our doorstep that I knew I’d have to make peace with the idea that one bright afternoon, sometime soon, you would be gone.  I watched as stones of ice rained down from the hidden sun, striking up an impromptu bell choir upon our rusted red mailbox and the hoods of our cars.  I stood beside you and I loved that your fascination seemed to ease your lips into half of a smile at least for those several minutes.  We both worried about cracks in the glass.  A few days after you died, I sat with family and friends in a quiet living room and your best friend cried when she said that all those years that pain and sickness had put on your face were now on mine.  Little dents in the metal. Tiny cracks in the windshield.  And you’re gone. Inside the mushroom cloud children chase eggs down an ashed lawn—So competitive! So American! They win!—wooden spoons against fine pink shells, blue shells, broken shells amongst the blades. Here Boy Scouts are always prepared and each radioactive girl wears lace and tulle backlit by the blast, sharp as fireworks on the Fourth of July. When their hair catches fire their mothers—God bless women with blowouts, tasteful shifts, kevlar vests— lean for melting eggs, plastic slipping through their fingers. There’s plenty of time to run for office, time to build a wall, time for petroleum products and foil wrapped chocolate, time for long-range missiles and even IEDs. God bless the NRA. They are making everything great again, glowing, full of promise and jobs and coal mines, fallout shelters a brand new industry and every school a charter. Here, each child is armed for active duty, dusty, high-noon shootouts, each child a silhouette against the backdrop of a bomb—each child an empty outline, a chalked outline against an ever-darkening sky. Here vocal-fillers are philosophy, other people’s houses or plants made from plastic. Flashlights nearing, the dark keeps secrets, whether campers or armies. These are not myths but morsels touching, half-breaths of children running across grass.           Surrounded in woods    the leaves don’t trust you      enough to fall.    They’ll tell you     escape is dangerous.  The entire forest covered in wisteria,   & phlox are carving out your throat      like red meat, like full moon hysteria in the house      where they found you      under an old mattress     after you had gone missing for weeks—your body now missing its femur.    Outside vandals destroy what they name worthless: the horseman, the oxen     —& Fatima, thirty feet off the ground with spikes   hammering into space   reveals herself only to children. She wails for those in hidden cabins, lean-to’s in dark forests. Fairytales all begin like this: A girl is lost in the woods and the woods are alive and branches reach for her cape, crimson, fluid, and so she runs to a witch’s house, a woman’s house  & she is consumed wholemeal or in pieces. She is frozen marble, pocked concrete. Why are the choices maiden, matron  & crone? Why are our eyes held in cupped hands, all-seeing and blind, wide open? Everywhere I turn flora holds its breath, waits for a hard exhale. The continent died with you, China  man with sun-snarled neck, mouth of gunpowder, skull  they’ll bury to face westward. Consider the trans  formation of a country that will outlive you, consider white  men on horses, a cruelty we all recognize. No more rivers manifest  their gold, only iron, only a brother’s bones stomped to wine,    the first rule they taught you: never whine  or speak, so you learned to sing of a sea china  -blue: a sea sung into the mouth keeps thirst from its manifest.  It is summer and hot and you dig so deep you hit skulls.  The white men say leave it . Left, they white  out the horizon, burn like bulbs, a light that will never trans    late as a Chinaman: the joke is who owns time, and who must trans  literate? 不会 . Married? 没有 . Legal? Hey, let’s offer him some wine,  at least.  This is America, after all. Haha, look how white  he’s turning – Ha. I’m funny – aren’t I? Almost as funny as a China  man with the end of his pigtail stuck up his – ok, ok. Back to business. Skull  well-formed. Teeth strong. Anus clean. Penis – haha. Shall we write – barely manifest?    In new country, learn only the names of things that could kill you: Manifest  Destiny, Mountain Lion, Irishman. In new country, learn to trans  mute: scoop an ear into the ground, curl inside like a dead language. Skulled  but never spoken, a language ferments, gives up its wine  -darkened mouth of Governor Stanford saying: long enough to reach China .  1776 miles, one for every year the whites    stayed: no Chinaman wanted to. White  lies to send home: even their dust is gold. Even gnawed bones manifest  new meat. Lazy bones , you were called in China  Acceptable meat , you are now in America. Call it trans  action, to leverage a knife against its rust, a grape against its wine.  To measure a man against the price of sending back his skull.    I don’t like the look of them, those slant-eyes, that skulk  about – it’s about – it’s about jobs , it’s about fairness , it’s about white  women – protecting – being a man .  They can’t even hold their wine  for God’s sake, for the sake of God, our God, ever-living, ever-manifest–  it’s a matter of values, beef-eaters or rice-eaters, our God or trans  send them back – send them back – back to Godlessness, back to China –    In California, I ride the train along a crease in your palm, trans  fixed: nothing can be.

I envy the violence of time—how the clock hammers through seconds.  The room rebuilds itself back to beige painted walls. I left my father in the desert under a mesquite. His lips signed  by the sun. Drink . Hands me a mason jar & water slowly fogs beneath an old rusted lid. His breath a salt lick close to home  yet far from god. A lizard on a piece of petrified wood swallows my passport & grins . Father stares down my small body & inhales  the fear out my eyes. & an exhale of canaries flood the sky. They sing a mother’s voice & disintegrate into the clouds & their surrounding  blueness. A wolf leaps down a cliff & morsels the last yellow bird to brush the horizon. All fear in his belly—I can hear it peck at the dark, tunes a sorrowful  prayer— a call to my father. In my hands I hold the skull of a wolf. I wake & in my palms a honey crisp apple. our home has a fence the color of dead blood. once my sister launched her barbie into the neighbor’s yard. while in flight the small body stares back knowing it wouldn’t return or at least not the same. the next two days the sky poured out all its water. a plastic girl goes missing & a wet tombstone is born.  my hometown rhymes with mexico & ends with a wall. a vertical ladder built all wrong. & lays on its side like a sleeping mother forgetting to feed her legacy. the children don’t know how to wake her. their bellies wail. mouths wide open. their tongues are a sea of small pink hands reaching for the sky. the same skin on braved-bone/ that once picked apricots on an orchard farm/ like delicate newborns/ such sweet children he had/ during the humid summers/ he slept under the shade/ of any tree/ praying to the moon/ or stars/ or god/ across the sky/ like silver dollars far from his reach/ how beautiful he dreamt that night of a home/ built of sore knee/ tired back/ when the orange man found a place in america/ some cheered/ some cried their body funeral/ but what does crying mean in this country/ my abuelo sits at the kitchen table/ fox news spills into the same air he labors to belong in/ his resistance/ swatting the fruit flies over a browned apple. I know you will know what I mean — that I am meant for you, back in  the alcoves, you come thudding in the nightfall and I am fallen, felled  like a poplar in the heartland, yes. back there is the trees, yes. I carry  the eyebright on my back, yes, among all this bacteria and loam. I am  never able to keep someone. and already in my side — a long spoke  piercing, a slash liquid — something to lay your hands into. my dear one, my white – tailed deer, my jonathan  apple and neuron fire — do you see these nettles I am holding? when we have midwinter, I think we have sadness too, like used confetti — a blanched asterisk under the glaze. this year has not been kind. awhile, I shook like jewelry, a beam refracting — iridesce nt and damaged. my strength never enough to get us through this fierce, eternal stretch of pine woods and pine boxes for every cadaver. the screaming begins again. I am mum, my hair lustering like confectioner’s sugar. let me ask you where to go for blesse dness. sustain me in the vein, in the vine with chlorophyll — to be a lush, expectant seedling. The ghosts walk into the kitchen and you cook them. No. Your grandmother and your mother walk into the Sunday kitchen and ask why you haven’t waxed your floor. You wax poetic about bleach and flour and how salt puts out fires. The smoke from your oven is a shade, is your grandmother’s white hair. You don’t ask why.  Your mother has widowed the mountains to visit you on the saddest day of the week.  The bare bulb in the ceiling weeps lemon juice, the lamps in the empty living room have sold their gold. Your lover left you in the middle of the night.  Now nothing glows, not even the oven’s coiled arms. Is it true your grandmother rose from her grave beside the brook without a trace of dirt?  Is it true your mother is not even dead yet? If pie, then man. You fold fear and three egg whites into a bowl of sugar each time you think you hear your lover whisper meringue. On the first day of class when he said I didn’t look like a professor, specified that I was not a man and not bald—I rolled my eyes in the way I have learned not to say I have known his kind since before he was born, have built a life in the glimpse of eyelid I get to see instead of the face in front of me saying, again, that my Ivy League graduate degree, two books, litany of editorial mastheads, and three years teaching college students (even some who knew how to weep at beautiful sentences, some who could barely breathe when we read Virginia Woolf aloud, though some were more interested in Ultimate Frisbee or the minimum number of seconds they could spend writing and still get into med school), that these things do not qualify me to teach topic sentences and close reading skills to men like him. Maybe an eyeroll is the closest I get to God most days, to looking upward and inward amidst the awful drone of the world. Some days I consider binding my breasts and buzzing off my hair that I have loved my entire life, how it might feel to not be a Ma’am or a Miss for a day. But, no, I will always be too small and in love with my softness. I will always be this quiet storm of blood pulled by the moon toward the edge of myself. I will always be shaking under the heavy beat of my heart arguing:  I am the brilliance of a brigade of daisies and barbed wire, I can give life and won’t. I don’t know why I didn’t get pregnant. How many nights in beds beside each other did we fuck soundless. Not for pleasure, but for men. How many sardine apartments of minor league baseball players, hotel rooms for road games. How easily could we have had the same last names like the sisters we are. Your ex-husband’s cousin with the fastball temper. The chair he threw across the hallway when I wouldn’t put out anymore. Sometimes I wish I was the teen mom, how a child can become an endpoint to recklessness. I think we were both reaching for an out. The last time as we were, I met you at a game on a college field trip where none of my new friends knew our story pulsing beneath the billows of a blouse you’d bought to cover what you were afraid to show the world yet: a curly-haired girl with weak lungs waiting for you to press your ear close to her choked chest and ask whatever inhabits the stillness of a room to fill her alveoli with years of breath. A girl you won’t want to tell about me, about how we loved to wade into the deepest waters and play chicken with Poseidon. Sometimes I imagine she’s mine, linger around the girls’ clothing racks and try to guess what size, what style she wears now, the feeling the first time she refuses everything I say is cute. How sudden it will be that she walks into the dangerous heels of our youth. The app on my smartphone wants me to translate  la mujer 3 come una manzana 4 . Easy. But it does not say if the woman has chosen the apple. It does not say if it’s the only thing in the kitchen of a low-A league Yankees slum 5 or if she picked it at a Kroger, felt it with her hand & said yes, I will put this one in my body. It does not say if the apple was sawdust in her mouth, or the most crisp, sweet flesh of a Michigan autumn. It does not say if the men surrounded her, seven quartered in a two-bedroom apartment. 6 If she thought they were handsome & wanted to touch their hard throwing arms. It does not say if she stopped wanting to. It does not say if a man introduced her to his teammates as mi mujer . It does not say if she scribbled pictures of weddings or funerals across the last dregs of dusk. It does not say if she thought herself  una mujer or una niña. If she told her mother she was off to a slumber party. Something about pedicures. It does not say if the apple skin sticks in her teeth, slices the gums. If she bled on the soft white of the apple or maybe the goodwill sheets covering an air mattress next to an air mattress next to an air mattress with her friend’s mosquito bite tits & a man who gets so drunk he pisses in the fridge. 7 It does not say if she was a virgin or if there’s more than one way to tear a girl. 8 It does not say if, perhaps, she found half a worm or condom & knew something wriggled inside her that she hadn’t asked for. 9     1. Memory is a mean drunk, always throwing her glass at the wrong targets. The language is not the problem. The problem, of course, is men & the things that remind me of them. I want to read Pizarnik in a hammock so loud the neighbors think I’m on something. I want her all over my tongue, my throat, my teeth. 2. How many pearls, how many laurels does it take to redecorate the past? Cheers to a doctorate in distancing. Cheers to how alone Texas stretches, the endless bright sky. 3. I learned this word in the first book of short stories I loved, The House on Mango Street , which Cisneros dedicates to Las Mujeres . I was fifteen & hadn’t been raped yet. Just a scrawny little white girl, but I knew Cisneros knew something about me, about how afraid I was of lemon heels & grown men who watched my legs too long & called me names that weren’t mine— Hey Buttercup, Hey Princess, Hey Babe. 4. What would this story be without an Eve to blame? 5. It does not say how the white American players were able to afford Hummers & Escalades, but they did. & the players from the DR & Venezuela all lived on chicken & rice & were very lonely stacked on top of each other by the invisible hand of capitalism. The first time I saw the room full air mattresses I thought, Slaveship . I thought, For what have you voyaged? I thought, Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. 6. But sometimes it was sweet. The men called each other Primo & raised Bud Lite cans toward the drop ceiling & spoke too fast for my gringa ears. 7. Maybe that’s not fair. Maybe we’ve all been too drunk. Let’s try a revision. Let’s say he gets so drunk he shouts Neruda: Solamente es un soplo, más húmedo que el llanto, /un líquido, un sudor, un aceite sin nombre . Let’s say I couldn’t translate the beauty. Let’s say I still can’t. 8 Weeks after, when I dipped the tampon in hydrogen peroxide to sting myself clean & raw, was that a spell? 9. It fails to mention that I named it Esperanza. The angels float overhead— one with curls, like me.  Their happiness is an omen. As omens go, this one must be interpreted. Until now, I thought romantic love was unfinished sentences and broken teacups, the ocean swallowing a girl on the jetty, her blue hat floating away. Tonight I think love is a memory of grace on the tongue. The moment before the embrace, the second after. In the painting, there’s something in the bold brush stroke of the artist and tilt of the angels’ mouths that makes me think of you and so, I write this letter, a love letter.  To you.  A man I have not met.  I want to tell you about bicycles.  I am ten years old.  My father and I ride together every Sunday morning, two miles, four, maybe five, heading west against a pale sky, bands of clouds pigmenting the dreams of all the people asleep or warming milk or opening curtains and brewing coffee.  No one else is out this early hour when the grass is still wet with evening dew and jasmine wafts across the city on long drawls.  My father and I ride silently, forward, freedom in the artist’s gestures, peace in her colors.  How will I paint you into my life? I see only one bicycle, a white basket, a green bell and oh how I love that green bell.  I close my eyes and imagine waking you in the night, your warm body turning toward cool pillows. I think of holding your hand at the farmer’s market where we will buy yellow tomatoes and blue basil.  I inhale the breath of your upper lip.  Catch you on the bottom lip. Your smile turns a sable paintbrush, pigment from the painting, linseed oil, chrome and rubber, a lilt of light— and here we are, a second bicycle created in this moment which is really all moments you have been with me.  In the clouds. The basil. The scent of June’s sweetest peas.  The kiss I have  imagined. I believe you understand.  As light falls in pinnate leaf patterns across the west-facing wall, I see you riding towards me. When I eventually tricked you into attending  my two-man circus I hadn’t thought you’d keep  there long. Maybe I could sell you  on an act or two—unfasten the rotten teeth  from my head and screw them back in a socket,  blindfolded. I had hoped the surprise would make  you take your shirt off. It didn’t, my dear, you even sat still as my father  continued the show—tattooing our family name onto  your arm. He was dressed as El Silb ón , exactly like his father,  and grinned when he offered you a shot from his pony’s mouth.  When you said no the whole tent caved in, trapping you  until the fire department came. They cut  a meticulous hole. Only for you. But you drew away  from the first ray which shot through, not as compelling  as it once had been bright across your tidy childhood  floor. Instead you took the sunken canvas from my shoulders  and by took I mean crammed it down your throat  until there was nothing left but sky. Sacrificial as any  magic trick. Instead you took on the puma, you took on  the whip, you took on every sharp part and let them dull.          Believe me, the body is cleaved the same  as the devil’s foot, the split  too large to view    from the ground. As the earth’s curve  refuses our clinging when for years  it refused to reveal its warp. I tell    my husband, place your hand here  between my mother’s jaw I’ve inherited  and the sickled neck of my father—    Here, bring an offering  of warmth to the boned caverns  which only sink deeper    after rain. He loses his grip  to the quiet of night. I keep watch, keep  returning his sleepy fingers to    my chest. I’ll teach someone so they know  how it aches. To carry home  both the Spanish ships and the cradleboards    splintering under their stern as they crush  the coast open. To contain both  the ransacked room of the living and the cache    of blood which fills it.        Thrift store or Walmart coin. The Last  Supper on one side, Jesus on the other.  My mother offers her daughters  matching pairs, tells us to keep it always,    He’ll protect you , and pockets one God  coin for herself. This is her way to feel  closer to us, as if the coin could thread  miles, a cup and string    she throws her love through.  I keep mine in my driver’s door,  upholding my promise  to never travel without it, and so far    two accidents averted, one so close  my bumper could taste the seconds  before metal gnarled and knuckled  under speed. But we never hit.    He saved me again. The last  weekend, a friend and I pulled over  in rural Alabama for speeding, blue lights  lit and landing us alone on the interstate    with a cop and all the names we knew—  Bland, Castille, Crutcher, Scott—  a list repeated as often as it’s added to.  I couldn’t decide how safe it was to record,    to place my hands in plain sight, to hold  the basket of my lungs ajar for air.  But I didn’t die. I didn’t even get a ticket.  Slow down officer Derek Jones warned me,    and I slowed enough to collect the shame  fear handed me. Life means  recollecting, so I picked back up  the stone fear his white face weighed on me.    I was scared of what he saw in us,  not targets, but two scared girls  with eyes like emptied night.  My friend is not a girl though. My friend    leaned into the space between cop and me  to stop a possibility, but I couldn’t save them  from the bullet of his she/she/she.  If I’m honest, the cop was nice.    He smiled the way a father smiles.  Said my name the right way when I asked.  Didn’t write a ticket, or ask us to stop  recording. Didn’t shoot.    A good man.               And still  memory sharpened the teeth in his smile  to fangs           and still I couldn’t forget  his gun     and still, ten miles down the road    trying to speak his name, my mouth shaped  slant, rhymed Derek with Garnett, as in  Sheriff Garnett Brooks, who arrested  the Lovings in their home and maybe    it was the hours I’ve spent with his name  but maybe it’s because every cop is him  to me, every cop a hound on prowl  no matter their kindness, their pity    biting through, and I know it’s wrong  to see white men as dangerous but I’m still  scared still angry still hating Derek Jones  for reminding me I feel this way. Sun sets like a man leaving his day job  to get to his night job on time. Oh, me?  I’m in search of any kind of permanence,  sitting in my car, watching the unreliable  light bleed out on the horizon, listening  to the minutes drift like smoke into nothing.  Nothing stays in this world— it is known—  yet I too will bleed in foolish defiance. Their small boat tilts and dips as they jump  into the shallows and run up the beach  to applause and cheers in English and Spanish,  twelves sets of feet already drying in the sand  as they high five and hug one another  and the strangers that greet them, calling out  Bienvenidos!  Bienvenidos!  You made it, bro!  Beachgoers give them the cloths off their backs,  the cash in their pockets.  South Beach hotels  bring food and towels.  Someone asks how long  they were at sea in that rickety boat. Sies dias,  sies dias. Six days for the dream of a seventh. My brown body is inherited  along with its jeweled head split  on a curb, blood lingering  on pavement. It is the red  birthmark of a nation.  I can’t stop clawing at my mother’s scar,  incessant legacy carved  into my flesh like initials in oak.  The body threads violence to itself,  welting wounds into offspring.  I discover the ache  but not the why or how of it.  My body remembers history  even when my brain is muddled,  as if one leg is shorter  than the other, a hobble  reminding me  this body’s belonged  to others before me.  It will see the same open casket  bear the same brown bruised face,  twisted mouth open as if to say  it remembers resistance. Am I somewhere in this body?  The “I”  once reprimanding me for indulging lost  men? When you say love, I hear love. You  mean like.  My eardrums damaged from that  way I bend, thumping tongue bruised like a grape  in mouth. Someone can be salvaged. You jawbreaker—  I’m hopeful. Maybe neglect blooms into a kind of missing I’d  repurpose into thirst. Honesty saved,  folded, tucked inside my belly somewhere for  a day when we stop saving me for last. None of it. That’s what I remember (forty years until I’d be born) about the end of World War II. I know you had stars on your chest. I know that bodies washed ashore by night, a world away, & in California, by night you kept watch for bodies—the ember of your cigarette bodying the soft breeze, its dim light airborne— a beacon almost, like Polaris itself—a lone point in the constellated war between bear & dragon. The war you fought wasn’t unlike that nightly battle, from the star-studded Bear Republic. You must’ve remembered its end, men come home to newborns at last, the still-rising body-count, as though new bodies could replace those lost at war, but you never said so. Reborn, at home, you bottle-fed a foal each night— the mare dead from labor. Remember. How couldn’t you remember the stars, fading with morning? The stars. The stars—celestial bodies disembodied, dismembered, wheeling figures, at war with themselves. The night before you poisoned the pond, waterborne spiders must’ve swaddled dragonflies, death born from necessity. By the time the stars resurfaced, & again night had spread itself, all was gone. Bodies blanketed the water. Another war was won—your pond, lifeless. You remembered that night so well. Dead, you can’t remember— not the moon & water at war, not the stars multiplied by each unborn body. The sun scatters light with abandon  on the bare hayfield,  straight-as-arrow rays, resolute in common purpose.  Yes: that’s the sun.    You and I too should beam so recklessly  on traffic, on strip malls, the rare and throbbing  bee hive, on icebergs nodding till they turn  belly up, green glass underside in polar sea.    To open from far up there, to just send your light out for years  until you hit land, until you casually stir  up a hurricane, until you light up such corners of human life  without regard for what it is we illuminate. sheets in a thunderstorm,  clipped to the line                    forgotten.    And later, tumbling around the hot dark,  static stars wheeling from the fibers.    Sometimes I picture it raw                  still on the stem,  plucked and pressed to a bleeding cheek,  seeds and all.  As if healing were so simple.    The fields quiver with boll weevils                  whose tiny teeth tear their own insulation,  feeding             like children in a fairytale        on their one chance for shelter,  seeing it disappear—melt—from soft flossy whirls of white into sugary grit.    Someone told me cotton scents are completely artificial,  that real cotton smells like sweat, or like something burning.    And now I see that the fields are on fire,  that maybe they were always on fire,  and I’ve been standing here, at the edge of an oily ocean                   burning. The man was there, and not, slaughtered for taking. Someone said suicide with much riddle of the tongue as if asking  why here? Why downtown Seattle where the sun beads down each scrapper  like a raindrop or early morning dew?   The flux of the city was comforting that afternoon, I remember. The Starbucks was closed. Chase bank, too. I watched police cars thicket, watched the ambulance sift through traffic. What could remain of him?  Him , another falling man. But his body found and hideous on both ends, sopped in his own blood.    Someone from work said better here than Suicide Bridge over in Aurora as I slipped between the pulsing crowd. I ached to find myself inside the splash, go rolling in it. The steamed gush rifled and the red, red of him flared my eyes wide, pretty, while the bust of sirens stabbed and the ill-rotting guts grew ginormous in its walk, washed me stunned as I tasted the flavor.    I was floored by the flight: the man leaping from the roof like a bird trusting its wings for the first time. Like a shirt thrown out the window, thrashing its thread and cotton for the wind—a dance so familiar the breeze would take the cuffs and twirl twice before leaving. Gentlemen-like.    During lunch, I ran outside into the after- scene. The thicket shriveled. The traffic barely combed the streets. I looked to the sky. It was Pacific blue, blue enough an orca whale could swim in its deep without stress. The twinkle of sunbeams serving as waves crashing on the banks of the mountain range horizon.    I was glad. Not because death promised arousal: how I shook with thirst: the image painting me hypnotized.  But for the man.                        It was a beautiful day  to die.               To give yourself back to the cycle. This case was not about a penis. –Lisa Kemler, defense attorney      The fantasy was a little blot  on your cornea, indelible red  in the morning mush bowl.  Where did it come from? Surely not  your own impossible head,  always burning & yet whole.    *    Did you visualize it after—not the act  (blood is old hat for women), but his  orphaned scrap—soft folds luminescent  with moon & waiting in a field  purpled with night, the itch & prick  of grass conjuring a ghost of heat as nerves  try to stir beneath a canopy of ravenous gnats.    *    Theatrically oversized in daylight:  the ragged-edged shadow it threw  as it was plucked from the ground  & held up like a muddy diamond  dug from the pit the policemen  had all imagined themselves into.    *    The next day, simple gore of another dawn—  the sun’s cruel hush of white like a blanket  on the smoldering pink. What did they want you to say?  The too-human slump of the fatly oblivious  clouds cast a reminder: god is already stuffed  with regrets. Maybe, with the little morsel  in your hand, you still felt him on top of you.    *    After an ordeal, panic congeals  at the back of the tongue. Almost sweet  in the morning, you can spread it  like jam across your toast. This I know.    *    Lorena, I can’t say I haven’t wanted to.  There was a time when I fell asleep  sucking on prayer like a kerosene lozenge  each night. But in bed I didn’t dare  swallow or unhinge my flaming jaw before God,  who must have finally said to you:  metaphor will not do. I. Bubblegum    Glum nuns class our sex with a lesson on mastication risks. Once chomped, they warn, Chiclets lose form—and every desk I jam my pink wad under is another hole in my belt. Does my gummy blob look fat stretched out? And does blowing count, all the girls wonder. My own sour reverie makes for sticky chewing: what if I wasn’t quite awake? What if no one believed me anyway. Maybe not so tricky: no take-backs they say. So I just swallow the past intact. Did you know, the girls ask, that it takes your body seven years to dissolve a gut-lump like that?      II. Dr. Pepper    Desolate means of measure call for desperate medicine dressed as pleasure. Determined to secure a proper popping this time, I shave off my shy parts and rub a burn into my skinny lips—nicks to plump me. Which way for a bitter taste to best sink in—long-savored or quick-changed? Either way, a spoonful of pain is remedy if I can feed it back to them. The ailment is congenital—girlhood—but the cure is commercial: learn to spin sugar from blood and this trauma sells itself.      III. Cookie Dough    Smart now, I coo on cue and echo mushy sound bites. Every kid knows undercooked goodies are sweetest, so I pick a make-me-up stick that says: tap my gooey center and sieve out my cute icky. Sex is food, and I practice wooing on myself—pig out then dig out the excess to leave my little pout underfed. Men hungry for girls choke on my come-hither finger, too. They sniff my virginity ruse baked into a prepubescent essence, but they forget to time my reckless rising.      IV. Fanta Orange    What the nuns should have told us: agents of rot hype a fang as sweet tooth. It’s always the bubbly ones shake me, sugared on sex and ego. Head fizzed to bitsy this time, I feel fit with a buzz and a clit, but my fountain’s open—hooch unguarded on the counter. Sparkler throat to aorta sputter: in minutes I’m a goner stoking the flame on low. My ornate fantasy gamut ranges toe to ear, but blackout fantasia is rote the second time through so I’ll spare you the parts I don’t know. Morning found me flat and tonguing a tang of old anger diffused.      V. Pink Lemonade    Having learned a limp tart is worse off than a naked one, I reapply myself: string my bikini up with a snarl and paint my face in neon strips. Only some choices are limited. Boys take pokes at puckered hips while I temper my rage with manicured tips. Joy runs thin, but my flesh packs thick with pulpy trauma. I can peel it off in strips and watch my ugly sting them. Bitters on the eyelid, my leaky wounds pry like interviews—and just like that, the gawkers all sour on me. Boys and nuns in chorus sing: put your clothes back on. A dress code cracked: coverall as cover-up when violence is unsightly. So I skin myself feminine. A tall drink of raw pink, I’m the girliest yet. My girlhood is blistering. I played with the sunlight splayed between grains, haloes  of ash around her sleeping eyes. Skeleton stalks moving  briefly in the yard. She told me about the bees, how in winter  they expel the crumpled bodies of their dead, dropping shells  one by one onto the dirt. Hive’s center, the queen warms herself  on honey. I think of the artist who scooped them in her palm,  sealed them in bags, left them in the window. Wheat shocks,  summer dark. An hour lying in the grass. Emptiness itself cuts  along the bank. I wanted to make this vivid, so vivid. To say  a passerine flits in the wind. Pistil, stamen, pollen floods my nose,  powdering tent walls, the acne scars honeycombing her face.  Sea’s rush, river’s stop. Seepage from a well. Everyone believes  in one rapture or another. It is summer, I am thirsty. My canteen  is empty. There is not enough water. There was never enough water. In her last year when the canal opened  and the ground gave up its black swans,  she was the one calling them – channeling their light through the soles  of her feet. Their hard red bills made of clay – bugle cries  moving through her like a child falling from a cliff. She saw faces  in the water (the tall plane trees asking to be saved), all of them soft  at the mouth. Wild yellow irises pushed up like confession.  They seem cudgeled by the wind, or hypnotized  by their own reflections, bending too close to the muckish  river.  What did she write, then tuck in the underwing?   Sundown  was a hermit’s candle, a golden rope around her waist.  There’s something  she tried to say – the wheat of Mary’s hair, her tongue pistilled with roots.  What the soil  won’t tell, but knows like a bulb, a soul awaiting another life. She ate  all the irises until her belly bulged weighted down in her castle of water  While Aunt Irene Kneels at the Coffin      I stare, clutch a hymnal, revert finally  to a prayer that the casket will not tip,    spill my mother to the stone floor. Light  from stained glass marks the backs of pews    and I decide to continue to pray, so right away  I ask that the Brussel sprouts in my garden curl    their small heads in that tender spot against  the stalk, safe from cutworms, cabbage worms,    the diamond-backed moth. I pray  for a pen that doesn’t leak, for a closed tent    in the forest of rain. Someone coughs.  Asking for health would be fruitless, I think.    Cells die everyday in the millions, sloughing off  in waves, an invisible trembling spray. Instead    I pray now that the radiator leak in the car  won’t get worse, that I can make the drive    north without a quilt of worry over my shoulders.  I pray for a closed tent in the forest of rain.    For my cats to always lie on sunny paws,  for the red globes of tomato to survive the fall. After the blood appeared, small spots of uncertainty  After the first slice through the fleshy abdomen  After pacing, smoking, waiting  After the wound widened, the womb exposed  After a year of hope, of almost normal  After a visit to Florida, to her husband’s brother  and his wife, palm-treed roads, sun a helmet,  laughter slapped among waves  After the doctor again, the body mapped,  the body exposed, poisoned with hope  After the pills, the vomiting, tiger-clawed, ripped  The uncle gets it, a small bag, rolled with  clumsy fingers, the smoke inhaled  After she coughs, her eyes tear, she bends  double, cannot bear weed, air, anything. First the guide led us by flashlight holding the beam above our heads  and when we stopped in a circle somewhere at the basin where the ceiling  went up a hundred feet he doused the light and now in darkness so total as to bring  one child to tears my father’s voice spoke to me over my right shoulder.  What’s that on your shoulder he said making the shape of a spider with his  hand, which caused me to shout and the child to cry harder. I was an older boy but  still afraid and more afraid to show him. When we were the same body  he drank long beers called Schmidts after his shift at French’s, when one summer weekend  he stole a relay switch to stop the belts, winning the strike. The relay in his pocket  like a tiny Eagle approaching the moon, separate from its source, and from its destination,  as my father took drink after drink. The cave was dripping I thought from the great spigot  of beginnings when our guide clicked back on his light. There is torture here, but really  there’s no death, said Virgil to Dante in the poem I had not yet read. Nearby but in a deeper pool  of dark we heard gone on ahead of us the voices of more children who were singing as they climbed.       The little cartoon Z’s above my head, I’m about to fall asleep, to climb them well beyond the borders of my cartoon cloud, when I hear the first horse huff and stamp its foot.  It is the Palomino, Sailor Boy, dead for twenty years. Then not only horses but the snails I met in Assisi, so small they climb the blades of grass. And then the boxer I carried up steps all her life, all her life  the front right leg never healing.  What is the sun you’ve made of yourself she asks, and all the animals stand waiting. With the rile of the calves brought to the slaughterhouses of my childhood. With the monkeyish cat, leukocytes amok like mice. Dear Miss Pond,    I’m happy my daughter has taken an interest in history,  we must learn from it if we are going to make credible analogies  between dead dictators and presidential candidates,  but she has turned a little curiosity into a dangerous obsession.    She travels through time and switches accused witches  with mannequins seconds before the flames devour them.  There are 6 no-name 16 th century women sleeping  on my daughter’s floor. She’s recently rescued Joan of Arc,    who says God does not approve of my television viewing  (which is B.S. God loves the NFL and she’s just a freaking  soccer fan.) I sympathize with my daughter’s feelings. It’s awful  that these women were tortured and killed. But as I keep saying    it’s none of our business. Why stick your neck out  for some woman who lived centuries ago?  How can I get my girl to listen? Get her to take a less  hands-on approach? Maybe interest her in becoming a librarian?    Sincerely,    Frustrated and Concerned Father      Dear Frustrated Concern,    You are mistaken about responsibility:  every human life is the business of us all.    While I understand your worry for your daughter  (what parent wouldn’t want their child locked  in a closet where they’d never skin a knee,  break a bone, sleep with someone  who has a venereal disease?)  I must side with her.  You cannot keep a child    from risks. Even if you trapped her  in her room, there is still faulty wiring,  forest fires, sudden  volcanic eruption,  meteorite strikes.    You say you’d prefer if your daughter  was a librarian; but isn’t she  already doing that work?    I admit I am biased here; in my youth  I travelled back in time and whispered insults  in the ears of great scoundrels on their death beds.    (I particularly enjoyed  the face of Henry    the eighth when I told him  both his daughters    would sit on the throne  and that Elizabeth    ensured no Tudor  would rein after her.)    Time travel is dangerous  and your daughter  is in peril  of altering history, but           unfortunately  that is the risk  of every single day lived.  Let her do her work,  though you should share your concerns.   P.S. Please remember that God  has never given a damn  about American football. Dear Miss Pond,    A month ago, I forgot some dough on my kitchen counter as I ran out of my house to deal with a family emergency. My family is now fine, but when I returned, I discovered the yeast had moldered and evolved agriculture, art, trade, and warfare.    No matter where I go in my house I can hear their voices. They want the war to end. The return of a friend. They want to save the day. They want to discover a secret treasure. So many want to get laid. They want their enemies and some of their friends to be smashed beneath a meteorite. They want to know why infants die, why bad things happen, why I’d make a world where evil exists.    I have no answers.    I never planned to be a deity.    At first, I tried to ignore them, but even with the TV on and a pillow over my head, I can’t escape the why, why, why, why.    Should I tell them the truth, their existence was an accident?    Should I just put that small world in the oven and finish my bread?    Sincerely,    A Baker Not A Deity    Dear God,    Do not bake that bread.  If mold has grown to civilization,    it is long past edible.  And there is always some    Noah-type who survives  Armageddon. Normally, I’d say    whenever you make a mistake  it’s best to be honest,    admit your wrongs, but in the case  of accidently creating a sentient species,    I’m not sure the massive  existential crisis    such honesty would create  would be worth it.    Every time a god has spoken,  someone has found a way to twist    their words to justify a little  mass murder. Gods are best    when they have little  to no interaction    with their creation.  After all, no god has ever    created on purpose.  Deities are less aware    than a teenage couple,  who thinks jumping up    and down after sex  is a viable form of birth control.    Our own universe’s  creator had only planned    to make an omelet.  When she cracked open    the egg, the yolk transmuted  into spinning galaxies.    She said, Yuck!  I can’t feed that to my kids!    and threw our universe  into the compost heap.    Let that small world  discover its own way. The Chilean  telescoped  Trappist system’s  rocky closeness  translates to seven  fellow planets  in a habitable,  orange-pink sky:  a lifting starkly,  sister-moons  transiting:  just envision  that size and looming  company  within the initial  data, that  dot of light  wavered, blipped,  anomalied,  in that obverse  way that detours  lead us to us    *    Sinkhole    Arecibo’s  radio  in the karst zone,  limestone-lush,  perfectly dug  is a bowl open  to all kinds of rain.    This rain, hard-dropped  yet unheavy—  escorted swiftly by  flora within—  stopped of a sudden  and roused the mists.    So fast  I felt I learned  the meaning of ghosts:  propelled by consumption  and need, hasty,  escaping the already  rapidity  of precipitation’s  finish, that  hatch undone,  series of equations  unleashed.    *    Monoceros    COROT 7-b, a lava-ocean Super Earth,  is the smallest exoplanet to have been  measured.      In Monoceros, COROT 7  -b and -c tuck quieter  than the constellation  among its kin. For these it has  chasing dogs, a set of twins,  a snake whose head  comes back as two,  and a massive bowhunter  who threatens all animals  on every planet.    So, Monoceros,  not only made for covering  distance, for speed,  is the solvent, purifier  of water with its wand so it’s potable  for other animals, of which  are we a kind?,  wielder  of a sword, a pen, the solute,  the burden;  extinction-canceler,    warrior, if there were to be just one. He was obsessed with electric cars  causing him to miss work  before he was fired, he submitted  a proposal to switch city owned vehicles  to electric energy  received a thank you letter  no further action taken    He built an electric motor bike  receiving tickets, citations  or jail whenever he was stopped  he donated the bike to his high school  he was before his time    He started hearing voices  I was a thief who had stolen his soul  the cat planned to kill him  the beams on the ceiling  closing in on him  because of electric cars  I thought it was drugs    He stopped talking to me  I asked him to move  said he was happy to go  but two weeks later  he asked me to marry him  and to let him know before his rent was due  I told him no    We had a daughter  his only spark at reality  He kept 99 Cent store toys  in his pockets for her    He was diagnosed  paranoid schizophrenic  but refused to take his meds  he lost his apartment  and lived in the park  near his father’s house  I saw him eating out of the trash  and cried nothing I could do for him    In the spring of ‘86  he was beaten to death in that park  for saying or doing the wrong thing  at the wrong time.          The gilt pears shine    like the hooded eyelids    of the Madonna peering from the wall    in shame and piety. The black glass grapes    tight with silk and wire grow round    as your lover’s eyes when she’d see you come    back into the room. Would she remember    your softness, Kitty? Like these velvet apples stuck    with pins and green    sequin-cloves? The fruit bleed    something dead and dusty in the lead    crystal bowl in my mother’s parlor    in the old house where the lights    don’t work, the gold cherub-sconces    unplugged from the walls. Outside,    the moon is new, unlit. Eat.    Stay here with me. Don’t ever leave. They licked the needles with their tongues after they’d dished dirt about his mother.  They licked the needles after they spoke of their own sopped-up blood.    They pushed the needles in and out in and out of a tight salt-filled strawberry.  The needles honed sharp enough to pierce his coat, sharp as the tack  my mother stepped on: clean through her left heel callus.    I saw it happen. I was lying on the floor looking up her skirt to see where I came from.  I saw it happen and felt bad because I’d left the tack on the gold shag rug:  the pointed end hidden in a jungle of golden fibers.  She told me not to look there ever again, not to look ever, ever.    Two women with poison needles made their point. One wrapped lamb’s wool  around her anklets so the bells wouldn’t give her away. I heard Amy Winehouse today, her music jacked up fast & techno, for my heart.  I saw how the leaves fell the way Rilke saw them fall: all motioning no, no, no.    I heard the brown bats that roost under the bridge over the lead mills.  And the cats fighting, the ones in heat, crying with the warn & want of a baby.    I live in a jewel-tone neighborhood. One day, as I strolled past the quietest house,  a small forest of Queen of the Night tulips  blossomed into a whole night sky.    By next day, the black stamen of each Queen weakened, let loose & wept.    Do you know that nothing outside of our mouths will save us?  A god lives in the amygdala, but he is weak, too, asleep under the new moon.  Did you see an angel’s viscera across the sky?    Back when I was young and always broken hearted, I fell, too, into a fever and drank  vodka chilled next to the fat halved lemons in the bowl. This past summer  after you made a different life  in Berkeley  I visited the old room  we made a home—  the way a ghost might visit  its shadow  & the room is  now repainted the color of  rust &  rotting enamel &  a boneyard of bricks  the view  out your window—  is  like the map I drew  my fingers across  & discovered  nothing. I wonder if  the dust  here is still  made of us,  a memory  & we still exist  somehow—& not  as a field of knives  buried & not  given a name, perhaps  silica  something that cuts off  calluses from  our dead  bolted palms—  & fills our lungs with  uncracked  windows. fringe |::| a fraying boundary |::| a line separating two political or geographical areas, especially countries |::| countries that flood in & out of each other’s gaping bodies |::| a body of water that does not end with the horizon |::| the edge of the map & the ghost ships anchored there |::| gold that frames the mirror |::| petroleum coating the tongue with coins |::| the limit of geography unmarked by bloody hands |::| asymptote of eyes refusing to close |::| the end of an executive order & the dead that come after |::| flank |::| surrounded by steel |::| the curve of a corral  & the horse’s broken jaw |::| the distance two people cross to say I love you |::| the emptying of language & the bodies that unspool in its wake. i . I mean, he is dead, though doesn’t this make him American  enough to demand the land he was buried in is his?  Doesn’t this entitle him to break bread with gods  whose names fill the sky with anvils?  Or was he just buried in random earth—  because I saw a truck drive over his grave  like that isn’t how people get cursed—like that driver  isn’t going to crack open their jaw tomorrow & spill out  ratones, conejos, cucarachas, & all their teeth.    ii . Who’s to say this soil is American anyway,  like have you asked my grandma?  She once swore the whole of California  belongs to her mother & my father still  calls this dead man Reino. That’s right, the whole  damn kingdom. Grandfather was, after all, an unruly man  he once pulled his spine out of a screaming mouth  & carried that hurt until the end.  Who’s going to tell him he can’t still reign  from the dirt?    iii . The U.S. government  denied my grandfather a military funeral,  denied they ever held him against a gun  & called them by the same name.  The official reason they gave was my grandfather  did not join the marines legally, & fine  but he still volunteered to walk into any slaughter-  house with a crown of bullets in each hand,  they could have at least sent a flag,  or the name of that truck driver,  or a throne. Of course I’m ashamed  to be made of what made me,    to perpetuate it.  I confused this word  with perpetrate for  a long time,  a distinction I still cannot really  understand.    When the bomb hit,  the little girl rose  like a dragonfly,  struck the ceiling with everything  she was made of,  and fell with the roof  back to land.    Her eyes pummeled purple, distended  around her skull  like dragonfly eyes.    Of course I’m ashamed  to be made    of bomb,  roof,  wing. For years, I walked the moderate path  that curbed at the end of the lit  doorway where my mother always stood  waiting. Each time the strangers  knocked, I covered my hair  or hardened my face until  I became another door behind  the door. A good muslim girl,  I slumped my breasts. I never had  sex. Instead, one evening, I slid  in a white tub. I fingered the little pool  in my bellybutton and drew the lick of  it down my labia opening  its winged cave. My mother,  who found me through a slit  in the door, said, ​ you come from dirt.  Later, I hid as I did this. We hid  in a green hood on a rooftop  the night he planked me down on  the wooden table, hunkered over  and breathed ​ dog.  All I wanted, then, was to swill  into the umbra of his body  the way I swept under the tub water  that evening and lay there  for longer than I could. On Easter Sunday, 26th March, 2016, a powerful bomb explosion rocked the populated Gulshan-e-Iqbal park in Lahore, claiming dozens of lives.    —with lines from Tomas Transtromer       I drive through the city, daily          hung in smog.  off pavements, men broom dust      like ghosts pluming through the morning light.      around me, the whole strength of the street swarms,      wants ​  power that remembers nothing,        nothing.  already I want to spurn each muck road    bodies jostled in each turning rickshaw        heads in each dim bus lined in a planetary light—  ​I pass open fields    ​I pass crowds, packed tight  I do not move​      I pass a man hunkered​​over a cow that hit his car    angered, he whets a blade, jerks her bulk down      tips the blade over her glinting eye’s black orb.      I close my eyes  my mouth locks like a double barrel    the seconds tick at my teeth  I see his neck buckled in my arm      I see this instant,  always here,  a fist in my ribs. The skeletal remains of a couple were found buried in a field, awkward bones  clanked in mud embrace. A hemp rope twizzled violently round their flesh.  Her arms clenched his neck; chins pensive on scapulas. Why was this couple  not buried separately in a proper graveyard? And no casket? Two sweet bodies  in a simple pit in a lost forest by a lovely pond. Enraptured couples have been  excavated a few times before: a 6,000 year old couple locked in Valdaro.  They might have died clenching, but it is hoped they were buried that way.  Lovers have been dug up in love’s fate as far away as Siberia by archeologists.  Why is this the exception, and not the rule? There are insects on all our skins. I’m still as fragile  as a daughter  dressed up for  Olan Mills with  Dorothy Hamill  hair and highlights.  Smile as wide as  the schoolbus wearing  grandfather’s green  stone set with a  store bought jewelry  making machine and  mailed across the  miles. Held by a  slender gold chain  over Fall’s best turtle  neck. Tilt your chin  and grin, girl. Put  your elbows like  so across this  log while a cool  New England  autumn is draped  down your back.  Shift your shoulders.  Hold your head  high because you  were Made In Texas  no matter what  forest or fauna  they pull back  behind you.  Look at your  life through this  lens: It is hard  and far away.  Be strong. Put  some more pecans  in your pockets  when you get  home. See if  you can crush  them with white  Keds. Go to  the beach after  school today to  wash away his  whiskey in the  waves. Drown  out her drama  in the dunes.  Girl—  There’s nothing  so bitter you  can’t bite back.  No place so  sad you can’t  save it. Ecology Exhibit: Natural History Museum, London     In the museum a giant balance scale, pans large enough to seat a man, only in this case it is not a man but stuffed hares in the brass workings. A motor tilts the two pans alternately up and down, up and down, see saw, and as the two standing hares on the left pan dip, a panel on the wall behind them lights up — WATER, FOOD, HEALTH, SHELTER — and as this left pan rises, the right pan with its one dead, prone hare (an d why ONE ?) dips — DROUGHT, FA MINE, DISEASE , HABITAT LOSS ; oh,  we all want to crowd onto th e winning side, but the mechanism , keeping  its steady pendulum movement, is equally true to luck and disaster . Recall how as a child you had to choose carefully the see saw partner of just the rig ht weight who would not suddenly bail at the lowest point and leave you to crash? Eventually, you learn  to read body language, discern  eye contact, scan the horizon, figure out  t he  best gambles to save your hide. The lone hare dips again. ONE is vulnerable. ONE is alone. ONE is not a herd or a gaggle or an ecosystem. ONE is an anomaly. Jodi Arias sings Dido’s “Here With Me” while she waits for the detective. People will be surprised she no longer has blond hair—that’s not the Jodi we knew—& that she can really, really sing. The vibrato on the word “breathe” is like the satisfaction of pulling a loose thread & undoing a hem. It’s believable. I believe it. She scrapes the label off the water bottle like the way he used to undress her.  Court testimony characterizes their relationship as physical without much tenderness, & Nancy, the court reporter, winces every time she punches “anal” into her stenotype, especially since its mostly vowel. Jodi sketches Snow White with a black eye severe. A pentagram. A wad of toilet paper we mistake for a carnation.  When Nancy leaves work, she hums Jodi’s hymn, pictures his body’s confusion in blood. I’ve seen the crime scene photos, & they didn’t shock me as much as I thought they would. Like strangling an ant pile, I can imagine wrapping my hands around a man’s neck. Filling his skull with a bullet of ants. Slicing a neck by tying a ribbon of blade into a strict knot. Each digital camera flash, a match ignited into fantasy, & for a moment, I cradle, very close to me, violence.            She said the ball of light entered her room and saved her life. She held it in her palm & let it dance. I said, when I was twelve, I captured fireflies in a jar only for the moment when their lights exhausted. Evelyn Lau said, when light shattered across the floor, & briefly, there was a thunder between us. By us, she meant me & my brother. When she said, hands stood shaped like shelters, I wanted it to be my own failures she described. Morrissey said there is a light that never goes out. John said an incoherent buzz, the flickering light in his bathroom, stopped him from pulling the trigger. I said, the light was a jellyfish with teeth, light was the gold piss after the sting. When the lord said, let there be light, it was hilarity in bright pause. When Our Lady of Guadalupe arrived, she was heartbroken. At her feet, a pigeon crushed under the weight of a Ford 4×4, its wingspan outstretched, preserved in its own feathers & blood. She couldn’t discern a skull, just a small boundary between where death was stamped onto concrete & where it wasn’t.  After 600 years, this wasn’t the first thing she wanted to see. Of course, she expected loss, but not its bones like Galveston seashells—you can barely find a lightning whelk or moon snail in one piece on those shores. Texas carelessness.  In the chapel built for her, there was cookware with intricate paintings on them. Juan Diego worked eight hours decorating a stone plate with roses, before there was a word for “art.” Another plate was adorned with Cuitlacoche comun’s delicacy, gray & arched like a wave. Her tilma wasn’t art. It wasn’t a sign or even a map. It was the future in bright red echoes.  Humanity, Guadalupe thought, was more like the stubborn laughing chihuahuas, not like Mexico City canaries & their stupid wistfulness. She crouched closer to the ground to examine the bird atlas, wept in ribbons & tributaries. I thought only white women was foolish enough to let you in. At least that’s what I heard. That you was a flu black girls was too concrete to catch. And even when we did, it was never like how you did them- they kids waterlogged treasures sleeping at the bottom of gracious lakes, or piles of dust in the trunks of they fancy cars, or dolls with pretty faces disconnected at the neck. Once, at the beauty shop, I heard that when postpartum comes calling white women kill they kids- black girls just kill themselves- a neat stitch snatched so quick and silent that it always looks accidental, like we punched the clock so hard that our hearts just gave out like we never saw the car or the man coming- until they hit us. But here you are, on my phone. And I’m staring at my walls like they been painted in spoiled milk and saliva. A baby that I aint healed from on one breast, a pre-teen so close to the other that I forget how to exhale for a second. I can’t even put them down long enough to hang this phone up.                   I did not mention the stitches. The dry reptile skin stretched so far it split down the middle.  The epidural I begged for its needle an elephant tusk lodged in my spine  that I couldn’t sit still. How they numbed me three times, and still missed at first  that I wished myself a ghost a soft flimsy sheet incapable of rending itself in two.  My Granny’s mama died in a delivery room and I don’t tell baby girl  that either. I don’t explain the mutiny of our bodies, that I imagine giving birth is rebellion  where we dare to die and live at the same time, except now, people are actually watching  the bones a riot, the flesh weeping and gnashing its teeth. I tell her it hurt, as some things do.  She doesn’t flinch. so you aren’t struck by lightning  & regardless this culture has no myths  about lit women anyway    *    the animal spooled in his own unwinding  calls you mother in some dreams    other times someone reads your palm  shaking their head, saying, no stars    align, no stars align    *    the sun decides you aren’t worth it. it’s true  the sky’s chakra is never wrong : peach puddles  lining the horizon. you dip your toes    in runoff, think of white divinations  soaring over a synth    *    broken, you won’t eat the raspberries, say  you shouldn’t eat what will stain    *    you sit at the mouth of the river  alone, like always, like you never have  before. it sounds like it’s singing baby    please go please but you know  no one tells the dead they’re not wanted anymore.      first, thread your eyes with lace & shells, paint  your nipples with drying mud, watch the cells flake  off your gold-wracked body    *    it’s true you used to look at skin  darker than yours & see your posture straighten    it’s true you’re ashamed of your bird cage, your glass  year, your short shorts & tan lines    *    what if you were a gold bangle placed on a darker woman’s  nape? ring around the cord around the  touch me my skin is a glisten you’ll call :    *    what if you were the black paint smeared  across your own dark cheeks?    *    so you say to the birch skeleton in the bathroom mirror  unravel me i’m all this stuff of the earth. the mirror could be  laughing, could be saying girl, in my light  you’re just another pale :                another unmarried :    *    you say touch me i’m the bronzer  like there isn’t all this death in here    *    welcome to the country of white sheets  & black bird cages, of everything-tasseled-is : of everything-  holy, the already-dead, your absence. Your mother tells you the virus levels in her liver  have increased past what is considered fatal.  She can barely tell you this without bursting into tears,  her mortality so clear to her now, it might as well  be on the other side of her bedroom. You’re her son,  but you wish you were a stranger, someone whom she deems  is inappropriate to fall apart in front of, whom she’ll  turn away from and scrub the dishes before she shows  any sign that she isn’t as strong as she’d like you  to think, that she craves tenderness like any human being.  Of course this wish drills a shard of guilt into your stomach.  But you’ve learned to accommodate worst. Loneliness, grief, despair,  what’s a little guilt in comparison? And anyway, what use  can you possibly be to her? The truth is, you’re told,  we’re alone in our suffering. No one can make our pain  any more bearable than what we’re capable of doing ourselves.  At least that’s what you tell yourself. You tell yourself that if  you’re submerged in the freezing waters of a body long enough,  the cold will start to hurt less than your mother’s absence.  When she’s gone, who will you turn to? On your nightly walk you see a german shepherd  lying outside a restaurant, leashed to a lamppost.  As you pass him, he crouches, bears his fangs.  You tense up the way you did as a child, late at night,  when you heard your father twisting the door knob  of your bedroom. “It’s me,” he said, “Open up.” You’re always locked  in some solitude of your own making. You’re prepared  to keep everything out. Even pain. Even gentleness,  especially gentleness. Who knows when people will shed the skin  used to fool you into thinking they aren’t capable of harm.  The disappointment hurts more than the violence: Your father  promising life in America will be better,  leaving you and your mother in Vietnam  with only that small, feathery hope. How you dreamed  of reunion. How reunion led to that door knob,  rattling in the night. “You’re your mother’s son,” he says,  “and she’s turned you against me. She’s turned you into hail,  denting the roof.” Good, you think, let me fall then,  let every house feel my anguish, my storm. the bottle was born full.  born of ferment:  enzyme, sugar, yeast, rot.    the woman was born a girl.  she grew into the bottle  like a ship.    the girl borne  her mother who gorged  on the bottle.    the girl was born  of the mother & the mother  borne the bottle.    the girl became a ship  christened & the mother  became ferment.    the bottle knows nothing  of love & cares little  of inheritance.    it knows only enzyme,  sugar, yeast, & rot—  in a small word, death. If we were the grey meat  of boiled chickens    they would know better  how to love us properly.    Would know it is best to suck  the oil from their own lips    rather than try to parse it  from the dead water.    Look, our bobbing girlheads  in the pot. In the tub. The river.    All that hair and smudged lipstick.  Is that a feather?    Look, all those gorged eyes.  Imagine, all that sight.         It’s true that I wanted to give the world something beautiful. The way it had given things to me. A trout on a hook. The stacked coins of a tambourine on my thigh. My sexual hunger like a red scarf. You would not guess this from the way my body moved. I feared everything. My life for their safety . Twisting the sheets. An electric fan swiveling its flat white head. The landed shark. Wanting my body to be eaten. Fearing a mouth on my skin. My body spending itself. In this way I often lost track of my arms, just as moths will sometimes rest, wings closed. Its belly a flat song. Once I felt my life enter my body, a swollen lungless light. Each finger finding its home. I was a spinning coin. When my body became a wild onion field, insects took their time with me. In that we shared a particular patience. I am silver in my want, ridged in lack, my brown & fragrance. Already the birch trees turn to face me, leaf hoards tissued w/ winged seed. Like me, these trees will rot from the inside out, paper husks a torn bed, a falling calendar of empty & speed. This body knows I am patient like an onion. My life for my safety . When I said yes. When I said no. I was raised to obedience & never forgot the habit. High in the avocado orchard, my body looks for direction. Your hands within the dark wrinkle of my hair. The earth smelling of oranges. This grace I’ll call my will. What testimony you brave is just dropped fruit fermenting below a skew of wasps. For me, I love the limbs beneath. The negotiation. When I bent before my mother’s carved feet, ants moved eagerly on the stone, feasting on their dead. Something moved me to take her face in my hands & kiss her immaculate mouth. Like any daughter I drank her. There is no love between stones. And I would kiss her again. An ant likes the taste of kin. I do not mind my own sweetness. The tiny drawers of myself hollow with love. Husks of dried wasps drifting in the heat. I say Father, Father . Obediently I cover the streaming eyes. The sting & sting.  Once I twisted a sticky loquat from its branch, a yellow weight to my mouth. Its fruit  away. A lost ant burned my tongue & faded. It made no difference at all standing there in the shallow crab grass, feeling royal, elegant as cross- stitching plum-colored  x’s into a fine hatched cloth until the world rammed into me, a sudden needle.  I was struck there in the simple weeds & backyard tree fruits, a glass doll blinking my painted eyes, coughing elderflowers, upending my dowry, a showering of tiny shells, the drowsy way my life awoke to itself. How my shame came to nothing but the sugar I keep after, this outright nectar, hacked & bled, the flowerheads I rub wherever I can.  Recuse me from nothing. For whatever I want beneath this sunshine stun-gun. I reach w/ both hands for wherever the body will fit. What was her relationship to the number six? Did you unbutton her daily bread? Does she mispronounce her own name? What are the names of her dead? Was she founded on nothing? Does she disengage the clutch & set the parking brake? What death does she prefer? What about her is autobiographical? Does Google love her? Where is her bankruptcy? Was her alphabet a soup that spelled itself in your gut? Which hand was she holding behind her back? Did the window keep asking her to jump? Did she ever lick a pistol? When is her leash? Does her art hate itself? Did her hair beat you like a whisk? Did she whip it? Did she whip it real good? Did she sip genmaicha from her own ceramic vagina? Did she swim inside the fish? Unscrew the lid of her caffeine habit. Remind me what time her body is. Name for me her favorite volta bracket. Show me her singing cutlass. Show me her Red Lobster. Describe her first syntactical fuck-up. Remind me what she tasted like. Place her finger inside the sewing machine. Encounter her in the privacy of my underwear. Spell her sense of cologne backwards, beginning with the letter “k.” Like women, birds  are bad news.    They come with cutting  vanes and steel    rachis. Hercules  shot the Stymphalian,    but not before  they’d shed their swords    and wormed their beaks  into the farmers’ lush    bodies. Here every  suffering will be made    visible or at least  not written out.    Consider how after  Procne’s husband    rapes her sister,  she serves him their son’s    flesh. One body  entering another    in reprisal for the same.  All characters of this myth    live the remainder  of their sufferings as birds.    Sister as nightingale—  symbol of scored    silence. The husband  under the tarnished crown    of an orange crested  hoopoe. Procne    transformed into a small  swallow, the act    of consumption. This punishment  requires she draw    into the cavity of her body  foreign pieces    of the world and let  them live. I reject    that I can either consume  or want to be    consumed, but I  admit I admire    the raptor that desires  another’s body    to keep beneath  her glowing field  of iron feathers.

The garden’s great, I fit into my thin shorts,    and I’ve embraced my suicidal ideations again.  It’s not like the last time this happened,  long ago – it’s been twenty years.  Back then I lived in bed    and went days without a shower.  This morning I’m out early pruning,  wearing a clean shirt, earrings, and lipstick,  wondering how much blood I could draw from my shears.    They’re more fantasies than rehearsals –  how everyone will feel such regret –  but the reactions are my biggest invention.  Truth is, no one would much care,    so I’ll keep caressing my ideations  like smooth stones in my pocket. She whispers “bastard” in my ear, her hands cupped tight,  breath hot, forbidden. I know a few swear words    and this one feels hollow, blank, but when mom says  “That’s not a nice name to call someone,” I know it’s a bad one,    it’s got weight. I keep it in my pocket for later when a boy  snakes his hand up my dress. For when a man presses too close    in the elevator. Say it in someone’s dark garage in high school.  Say it in the basement of the library. Say it to my husband.    Angelina has had it in her pocket a long time: embedded  in her hip bone, a quick-draw curse for her father,    her brother, her brother’s friends, her friend’s brothers,  and the men who blew up the hair salon    where her best friend sat, spinning in a chair,  hair curled for communion.    Later, after the world has lifted its skirt to me and bared  its dark weapons, I will see a photo of her and her daughter.    She is still a baby, toothless and clean, and words slip  off her skin smooth as milk. She may never need to say it.    But for now, we will say the word over and over.  It tastes like smoke, spice, smells like Angelina’s breath    when it is close to my face in my bedroom in the dark  where the night falls down around us like so much    pipe bomb shrapnel, a girl’s soft hair,  a girl’s parted lips. & i hate it when men put my legs behind my head when they call me “oh” like it’s become my new name;  & i hate it               men put my legs behind my head call me “oh”                        become my new name;  & i hate                    men           my legs                    my head my new name;  when they leave i clean the floors. when they leave i do nothing but eat beets, their skin sticking to the roof of my mouth. i am too old to get/ fucked up on boys anymore./ everything is certain and/ blunted like/ an avocado pit.  i listen to static on the radio and i/ drive to work and i/ run my hands up and down the/ steering wheel.  i don’t care about their/ baby teeth. i don’t care about their/ ex-girlfriends./ i am too stupid to/ think about love anymore.  and besides,/ how can i get/ drawn and quartered on/ men?/ i leave my body before they/ pin my arms down/ like/ mothwings.

I do not think I love it yet. so instead, I will worship with quiet hands. I will collect breads & cheeses & atmosphere to display upon its altar & I will welcome fullness. I deserve to be full.  these are my hands. too often they are just hands so today they are a church. today they are a spell book & a secret & ten tiny lineages of drowned witches and spilled milk. see how they are simultaneously little and big? see how they are mostly bigger than you think they are?  these are my breasts. my shoulders. my collar bones. I like them. I will trace them with hot vanilla candle wax by moonlight but also I’ll just like them. like like them. adorn them with nothing but air & marvel at how 8 year old self would marvel at the miracle of her ripe and weathered body. how she would not not notice the veins & the puckering but how she would see them. just see them. just see alive & alive & alive without afterthought.  this is my vulva. I wanted to skip over it between the legs and the collarbones. wanted to treat it like another middle thing. as if I would not come back here, like now. like always. it hurts me— standing. still. thinking of it. but only because I recall its occupants before & instead of remembering my own architecture. this is my vulva. it is not a flower or a pocketbook. not a refuge for weary incessant honeybees or a timeshare for loose change. it is my vulva. I love the way it makes me feel but that is not the same as loving it. take a hand mirror. position it between your hips. do not think about shaving. dare yourself to see alive & alive & alive—  dare yourself to be a person. not a poem. do not try to add a punchline.  this is my body. she is good like a body. not like a narrative of theft or abuse. I owe no one my robberies. whether in a story or on a street corner either way they are craving my flesh. demanding Detail. demanding Blood.  but this is my body. I take inventory. I show up. I do not “just” show up; I Show Up. it is the bravest thing.  this is my body. I do not know how well I love me yet. instead, I will feel how good it is & I will know that it is good, remembering another oft forgotten middle thing—  the space between the healed and the healing.         Pregnant by the moon, I shoo him away from my windowsill.  I don’t tell him it’s whiskey in this Dixie cup  I don’t tell him I never go to the grocery  I don’t tell him I threw away all the oranges,  still ripe, still good.  Voyeurism is illegal in the Midwest, I remind the moon,  while my belly grows. You’re little, you’re small he calms my fear  I don’t tell him sometimes I want the sun  or where I hide my cash.    He is perfect –He does all the moon things:  Waxes, wanes, reads non-fiction    I don’t tell him my skin is too slick to hold. I was ten years old when I read about the boy  whose mother drowned in the ocean.    It was in the Scholastic News—  the aluminum boat leaving Cuba,    the shipwreck, the 10 more dead with her,  the boy floating on an inner tube until rescued by fishermen.    His face was on the front page of the magazine  and I wanted to kiss his paper cheek. His name    is Elián and today he turns 23.  My mother shows me a picture    of his mother. She is beautiful in the way  all mothers were in the 90s—    all bangs, high-waisted jersey shorts.  And I don’t know what it is to lose a mother    yet. I won’t see her scoop water from a sinking boat.  My mother came here    on a plane and I thank a god. A different  island, a different year, a baby girl,    not me, in her arms.  Elián went back to Cuba.    And I have never visited the island I’m from.  And I feel like a bitch.    Because all I did was read a story  Then retell it on this page. I google disability for depression .  They’ll want to know how crazy I am before  I can benefit. They want to know how many  hospitals I’ve slept in. I can’t walk  to the mailbox some days.  I can’t boil the water. I forget  to feed the cat, change the litter.  She bites my feet when I walk passed the couch.  She scratches my face after I give her a treat.  My mother calls her manicomio. Insane asylum.  The place. Not a person  in that place. I put on lipstick the other day.  My sister thought I was cured.  I bought fishnet tights and started watching porn.  And I wanted to make a beautiful sound with the others  on the screen. Like the time at Lake Tahoe,  a group of us chanted to the Devil and then a woman  went missing on the mountain.  Or when another patient asked me about electroshock therapy.  He said I seemed normal  and could help him make the right choice.  I don’t remember what I told him.  I might’ve said do it , might’ve said don’t .  I might’ve said nothing, mind in the ICU  days before when I promised the paramedic  that if he told me a story I would stay awake  long enough for him to put the tube down my throat.  He didn’t tell me a story, but the tube  lived inside me for two nights. And they strapped  my arms to the bed. Listen, little Madeline.  We aren’t much different. I’d gouge  the eyes of anyone  trying to keep me alive. When we found her sex positions book, we  didn’t think it was real.    My mother wasn’t cool  enough for sex. We    flipped through the pages, turning left,  studying where each body fit in this school,    the detailed figures of the man and woman, the parts we  hid under cotton, kept from the lurk-    ing skin, a hand, a finger, the late-  night moon with its borrowed light. We    lay our bodies on the bed, to strike  the pose, mimic the face down, the ass out straight.    We laughed and snorted, we  looked like pigs, sing-    ing oinks, our faces in the trough, this sin.  I don’t want to say what we did next, that we    touched our own bodies, thin  limbs reaching to what bits of hair we’d grown, the begin-    ing of a secret thing, or that we  reached for each other, a fumbled jazz    of grips, on this solstice in June.  If today, I could replay our hands’ song, we    would deny its music, when we each die-  d a little on that bed, notes ending too soon. The Mechanics of Flying (figs. 1-3)   It is said that burning sage  keeps restless spirits at peace.    Once a year for three days  Daedalus sits  under a mobile    crafted from the bones of a  sea bird    and watches the smoke  cling like feathers.    ___    Two girls  were building a bridge  across a creek,      under a rock and covered in moss  like feathers  was the skeleton of a sea bird—    it couldn’t fly.    ___     On the third night,  Daedalus had a dream  that a great dragonfly was upon his chest,    “To fly, you must also be the wind.  You know how to be the wind, don’t you?                       You just put your lips together and blow.”    When Daedalus woke from his dream he was very still.    On his chest was the perfect ash of a sage wand,  he took a breath  when he exhaled  he became the wind.            The Story Doesn’t End Until We See Icarus Again    Think of the sun as an eggshell,  and think that Icarus’ descent—due to a trick of  light, and Daedalus’ failing eyes—  was actually ascension.    In one acrobatic swoop,  Icarus skipped like a rounded  stone into the sun, gave it a  good crack, and crawled inside.    Think of the embryo of a sea bird,  its molecular structure more  fluid and element than  sea-farer  or flight,    Think of the currents it created inside the shell  as its limbs, eyes and throat form  in mid-hatch  hesitation.    Think of its viscous wings  as it stills  and breathes,    of Icarus now,  being made of nothing but  salt  and feathers.            The Mechanics of Flying (fig. 4)  ___    For your stemware,  you could use Daedalus’ failing  eyes as coasters  when your not-quite steady  hand  pours slightly more  merlot  than you wanted.             The Second Coming of the Sun    Icarus hatched from the surface of the sun and seawater,  had to teach himself  how to breathe again—    (he hadn’t used his lungs since the  fated moment when the pads of  his feet left the tower; he will also  argue that lack of oxygen and not  hubris is why he was unable to  stay in the sky.)    It wasn’t until the hatchling’s egg was gone  and the basin of night filled  that he remembered equal parts  exhale  and inhale    when he slept  it was the movement of water under his nose  that reminded him of the tether  of his father’s beard.            Incubating Nymph Becomes Icarus Anisoptera    Famine at sea had made his eyes bulge  like ripe apricots,  his only consolation,    a fishing net that had freed itself,  bringing him fish scales, sea moss, the odd hook  or coin worn to a shine:    Icarus of salt and feather  had become Icarus of  crawling sea bed, Icarus of  his own weaving, Icarus of clove-hitch or  eye splice,    Icarus who spread his arms wide, whose  serendipitous net hardened as he brought it  out of the water across his back,    a dragonfly,    who in a surge of rapid-beating iridescence  became flight again. During my top surgery consultation, my partner says  to the doctor, tell me what you will do to their veins      and no answer will satisfy true  blood flow or this boy who loves me.    The truth is, as I sleep, everything directly above  my heart will be cauterized.    Facts are difficult  if you are able to recognize them    as fact. I am scared  of my partner    being face to face with my blood  because I love them.    When we talk of the future, my future chest is as flat  as our future backyard. We plant    a lemon tree and it grows  even in winter.              During the blizzard we ate ourselves sleepy, animals bedding down for the winter. Pasta and jarred sauce,  too much sex, and I felt a UTI coming on. We’re lucky these mistakes aren’t ones that last.  How many babies born nine months from now will be named Jonas for the storm? At least one, right?  In New Jersey my mother says who would think her children would be so desperate to get back to Brooklyn where  my great-great-great grandfather was clubbed over the head and thrown into the Gowanus. My great-great grandfather got the telegram  FATHER IS DEAD STOP COME HOME STOP  There’s a lacuna until my grandmother has seven children: two sets of twins, each time a surprise, and she cried.  My aunt was in love with a boy who died of AIDS. Before that he stole their TV.  I was nearly born on the Brooklyn Bridge: rush hour, head crowning and my uncle groaning “loco, otra contracción!” so my mother almost threw him from the car.  My love was born in Manhattan, but when I met him he’d already crossed the river. A dialect quiz shows I know about Mischief Night and he has no word for October 30th.  When he moves from Williamsburg down to Borough Hall, I more or less come. I like how I look naked less in this new bathroom.  All of our windows face central booking, which means someone very near is having the worst day of their life.  We suspect but can’t see it. What I know for sure is that the tulips stripped themselves pink  while we were in Jersey for the weekend. We returned to them, unwatered and awake,  not knowing what to expect when we bought them greenly at Whole Foods. It rains for a week. Not really but that’s how the clouds feel.  In another year this might be snow but we are inside the warmest year on record. So was last year, and the one before that. Today  I saw a baby so raw and new, I couldn’t believe it was in a restaurant the way you don’t see baby pigeons outside the nest.  In the pizzeria she was learning she had fingers. There are cellars of cheese beneath these streets  and I don’t know how they keep rats out. You can’t go there, but you can buy a slab at market  taste the rennet and salt and know you were an animal over the earth, wheel ripening underfoot. Finally this forest may offer up its bounty  after the dry winter and last night’s rain.  We are all here, even Addie  who has been eating poison for months.  Mysophagists ask that we not consume toxic mushrooms—  it reflects badly on them if we die.  A picture of the death cap  looks like the creminis I sliced for salad last night.  We spread out, family and friends, looking  for growing things, vegetative colonies, mutating cells,  searching not for plants—but fungi,  like mildew, or smut, or yeast.  They look like gnomes and sea creatures,  one a puffball like my daughter’s pregnant belly.  Yesterday Addie shouted out Fuck cancer  and today she wants to photograph shrooms.  I don’t know how to identify the edible ones,  so I decide the most beautiful are psilocybin.  We need to fill our buckets.  I’d like some chanterelles, Addie lobsters.  We hunt for an hour until a light rain falls  and we grow still.  I fear we don’t have enough yet, but enough for what?  We line them up on a log  and Addie sets her camera.  When she posts the pictures, all the red, fat, bulbous, phallic,  oceanic, pulpy, orange, black-spotted mushrooms,  all the laughter and spores,  float freely through the wet woods. Mother pockets the wind in her glove. Mother recites erev shabbat & birkat hamazon. Mother picks Gushers at Target. Mother picks sweater stitches from my mouth. Mother sighs. Mother coughs. Mother is a statue, but tender. Mother is a birthday present, wrapped in newspaper—the opinion section, not the news. Mother rises the sun with her eyes. Mother reminds me to love everything, even my shame & my fear & my longing, & my longing. Mother lets go of my hand, says it won’t hurt—        You ask me to take the Christ costume  out of the closet. It’s been a year    since your consciousness went  missing—stunned out of you    into the road: collision of machine & boy,  no pulse in your wrists, your ghost    gasping. Crash doesn’t capture it: your halo  ringing as it bounced from gutter    to sidewalk, singing down concrete  end over end. I wonder, did you throw    your shoulder against your eyelids, wanting  to burst through those last slits    of light? Your recollection of this  is dead, as is the seven days    after. Yes, the neuro-surgeons were pleased  when you answered: your name, the year, but didn’t    know your whereabouts. You told us in nature , lying  hazily in chirping forest, or at a tattoo parlor    getting ink on your abdomen: the half-arch  of a rainbow. Sometimes, you’d remember    you’re in the neuro ICU & we’d  celebrate. Funny—the detachment of body    and brain. I smile when I see the party photos  you post online: you, dressed as Christ,    thorny crown, death metal makeup,  bottle of Hennessey in your hand. I know exactly what I wouldn’t give  to stand in that haunted house again—    to have the long goodbye, fated-to-fail  antidote to calcified sorrow.    In the desert, a pillar of salt could save you.    *  The golf course, bitter reef of  abandoned grasses, flickers.    Traveling between shadows,  our skins pull away from themselves.    I lie in the dead heat,  not knowing that when I get home    the ocean will throw back  a skin of drained jade.    *    In the desert, we are all warriors,  venom is everywhere,    and the known world only  the beginning.    *    If you love your world,  you publish her secrets,  open the gates for anything alive.    *    In old stories, the sound of rain was medicine.  When the wind rides low    and you feel the blood coming,  remember it is only    the god you learned when you were young,  returning your call. I am that woman in your book club who, when everyone’s  laughing at a certain passage, has to point out that the metaphor  also contains an intimation of death.  And I’m that mother, who  when her child asks from the sticky back seat of the car  what’s a blow job? doesn’t even pause, just launches into  a few accurate details. At a party someone told a joke  about a merkin, then squinted one eye at me, You know what  a merkin is, right? Scout’s honor, I answered As opposed to  Canadian?  Head on, straight shot, bourbon neat no ice.  I’m serious.  One day I found myself on the threshold of a Stone Age tomb  shaped like a vagina—the guide said entrance to the womb ,  but come on, I wouldn’t even let my daughter’s boyfriend  get away with skirting the V-word, which froze him in place  under the kitchen fan, forkful of spaghetti halfway to his mouth.  Anyway, as vaginas go, this one was big—63 feet long, 3 feet high,  all stone slabs in bas-relief that had held itself together  for 5,000 years. We crouched low, tucked our cameras tight  against our chests. If you  get claustrophobic , go in last .  It was dry and stuffy in there, but nose to butt, we inched  the length, a line of pale elephants in sensible shoes.  One guy, thighs and belly of an aging linebacker, got stuck  Winnie-the-Pooh style, with his shoulders banging hard against  the tilted stones, until finally he popped through to breathe  quietly in the corbelled vault at the center of the mound  where the cremated ashes of our ancestors were laid  in what looked like large stone bassinets, beneath the spirals  dots and chevrons they had carved in the stone ceiling  like night sky on acid.  Lights out —We stood together,  sightless as miners trapped beneath the ground, until someone  flicked a switch and a riffle of weak light entered, crept slowly  down that tunnel, like a winter solstice sunrise beam,  to edge our sneakered feet with gold. Did I say tunnel? when I talk to my mother about loss  she says human         she says el rasool  even the prophet       peace be upon him  lost some of his children    and I see him wide eyed still searching  beads between his burning fingers  almost humming   ayah after ayah  his heart newly washed in a bowl of snow    and I am running after him  moss smearing  on my shins     yelling his name  like a fire erupted in my throat    flames  at my teeth curving into a battle    and he never stops      doesn’t turn around  the cloth he’s wrapped within never once  catches on to the branches     his shoulders  spread back to near snapping point    and I hear the nightjar flying from branch  to branch      its call changing each time it turns  a moth withering on its tongue    then later a stone to throw. It’s early afternoon when you take  to the streets after school.  In this memory, your mother is home  smoothing the creases in your uniform  after sweeping the hen’s bloodied feathers  from the kitchen, waiting until you’re home  to crush the garlic for the mulukhiya leaves.  The block not too far from here always smells  of bodies – the small hamama cooing,  beak breaking from insistent pecking,  rabbits hanging by their hind legs,  skin taut and burning orange,  and your own body, stifled by cotton,  by the ash already starting to spit out  its grey teeth in your lungs,  smoking behind the market again, sun-bent  fingers twitching like dust trying to forget  how your mother was crying  of a dream in which the hand  of every person you ever loved  was reaching for you from a river  whose current surged, their fingers swelling  in the progress, palms barely recognizable,  African Tigerfish swarming again and again.  In this memory, you watch the children yell  at each other as the women clip shirts  to the clotheslines, clouded suds  touching your shoes as the butcher across  from you chops a leg, holds it down by its ankle  on the board, saving the feeble bits of wet fat,  pressing between two joints he can’t name  but knows how to crack apart in one breath,  the thought of which keeps the cigarette  still between your fingers, suddenly overthinking  the motion, hands hardening at the solemn fact  that any bone can whither, fracturing under  the proper tool and with the right wrist motion  no matter its name.  In this memory, you never  put the cigarette out,  it hangs from your hand,  insubstantial, as small as the space between  two bones, between two dusty lips left open. In this memory, you see a red fox run across a field in a rainstorm. All of this takes place on the side of a mountain. In your mind, you are always far from home. You pull water in through the window: what to do with the two girls you have made . There is movement on the periphery. You want to make them torch. You want to make them ax. They are: two trees, waterfall trunks and arms made of leaves. You sew spikes to their feet, sharpen their fingernails while they sleep. They grow soft padded hands, luminous teeth. They are ready to glacier, to sheer this topsoil off and leave a valley of frost flowers. It is never safe, even alone in your cave. There is someone on the bridge looking for you; he wants to bury your body in the woods. In the parking lot. In the park next to the river. The fear is interior, but he won’t know that. Your face will be pixelated, shadowed, plaster and lathe. He will think you’re laughing. He will make a play to burn down the forest. To take the glass out of your windowpane, out of your wind chime. To paint a field on fire with your blood; he will fail only so many times. These knots of thread will become haystacks, past evidence of evidence that no one saw in the glare. Even the forest floor of newspapers is muck. You remember that castle of paper tubes, the staircase of pallets: if we burn everything, can we start over? Stick trees prick the sky and pricks strip the trees for life. A murder sings a broken piano chorus: you, you, you, are all going to die . Crows split apart in black puzzle pieces to peck the headlines floating, bloated in the puddles of ripped out roots. 36 people died last week in a ghost ship. Your heartbreak feels like you’re molting, but there’s nothing underneath this beat.  I fill my mother with air from the gas station  pump, four quarters strong.    I wash her back in gasoline and oil, curl  her hair over bolts with a wrench    the way she wore an old shower cap tucked  over pink rollers and a bathrobe to school    when a boy tried to kiss me on the playground.  She made sure to walk me to the front steps,    cold cream and all, with the bell ringing  and that boy waiting just to say,    my daughter will look  like me when she’s old .    I stand at the sink and rouge, pluck strays that  beg at my chin, color the greys    that have tinseled and still she says,  propped in the backseat , keep living, girl.    There is still room in the tank . I ask the lion lurking beyond the irascible tempt of longing  to open his mouth and come closer, closer. I put my head  inside his jaws, feel the moist smite of hot breath against  my cheeks, catch a shiver of antelope blood on my tongue.  I call him King, ask if he prefers a different name, if  the unspeakable loneliness of kings ever makes him wish  he lived elsewhere, perhaps in a luxury loft in some sprawling city,  had an office job that paid a touch too well, could ride  a train to and from work, nurse a planter of grass on his balcony  and sweet-dream it into the Serengeti whenever he felt  a pang of homesickness blooming in his gut. I turn to look down  his throat, expecting to see a pink fleshy cave of  hunger. Instead, I find a round window revealing the peppery  blackness of night, a host of giddy stars shooting  through the vastness. I forget my life is hovering on the wild  edge of slaughter, then remember. I close my eyes,  expecting each passing second to be my last, for the lion’s teeth  to tear into my face, crush my skull like a cantaloupe.  I wait until I become a part of him, until the sky cowers into itself,  swallowing me like a tooth. Soon I sense him crying,  a child’s soft, voiceless sobbing, a song. I open my eyes, see  I’m wearing a watch, sitting alone on a park bench in the dying  orange of evening, feeding stale bread to a posse of pigeons,  while above me an airplane crashes into the sun. Binoculars raised, we inspect the sheen of feathers, the curve of a beak, and record the time and date of the backyard sighting on the inside back cover of Birds of San Francisco which we keep in the top right-hand drawer in the kitchen.      On NASA’s website, a time-lapsed satellite photo of the earth at night. Europe and India are fully illuminated, as is North America, especially New York but most particularly, it’s Japan that glows from above—a convergence of neon and incandescent streetlights, headlights, nightlights, flashlights, camera flashes, flashing lights on smoke alarms and teakettles. From outer space Japan radiates, a brilliant star surrounded by seawater.      The BBC reports a major earthquake in Fukushima, damage to the nuclear power plant rumored. Thousands are evacuated, though officials say there’s no public health risk.      Something has to be done. No counter space, no insulation, a broken window, nowhere to put recycling. More than anything in the world, we want a dishwasher. Also one of those spray attachments for the faucet. They look really handy.      Al Jazeera posts early headlines: a tsunami, human toll certain but not quantified, damage from the earthquake undetermined.      We sign with a contractor who uses environmentally-friendly products. The job will be completed in three weeks, and decisions must be made immediately: window cranks, drawer pulls, sink depth, cabinetry, and the shape of ogees. We consider more than forty shades of white paint. It makes us quarrel.      Kitchen walls down to the studs, the house is filthy as a dirt mine. I try to meditate, but I’m afraid, obstructed, air traffic is disrupted. The sky over Japan is emptied of planes, birds, words, paper and that into which it is folded.        Flash of red and an echoless thud—a robin crashes flying into the window. Gray and white feathers quiver on the sill like prayer flags too late. Flapping in the wind, they cover the stoop, the stairs, the sidewalk out front, far more abundance than seems necessary to keep one bird aloft.      Technicians attempting to prevent meltdown are ordered to evacuate the Fukushima power plant.      Outside the kitchen window a chorus of robins erupts in the cherry tree, its blossoms pink and violent as ten thousand hearts breaking open all at once. Online, it’s Japan again, spring weather and a plume of toxic wind blowing east by southeast.      The contractor issues another change order. New studs this time. Progress is delayed ten more days, costs exceeding 300% of the original estimate.      Tokyo Electric issues a press release stating they expect a conclusion to the Fukushima nuclear crisis in early October.      We didn’t count on the toxicity. A compound used to glue the countertops triggers an intractable migraine. We flee to Paris at the end of our endurance.      There’s new construction and from the window of blue room on Passage Sainte-Avoye we no longer witness the swallows’ death-defying dives into the cobblestone courtyard, their trust in dusky Parisian air. The way it always lifted them up again.      We lost the bird book, tossed out with all the kitchen rubble, no doubt. We adapt to the new sink depth, but the spray attachment is a disappointment. It never works quite as we imagined.      I fold paper for hours, origami cranes to string along the edge of the radioactive sky.      We can’t get over it. We mourn Birds of San Francisco like a lost Eden, symbol of something irreparably broken. Something we did wrong. PRE-INTERIM SUSPENSION     boy, you’ve got a silhouette no one else wants  & you’ve got the kind of hips men midnight-snack  on & baby, you’ve got gun arms & chapped hands  & girl, you’ve got that swig/sip down & hey,  kid, where are you running to? there’s no bike trail  or ocean far away enough for you to body through  & still be able to come back & you’ve got the kind  of small wrists some people will look at & dream  into cuffs & you’ve still got enough ability to pedal  through a whining night & girl, you’re gonna hafta  work on your boy-walk if you want to make it out  of this undertow with your full jaw unbroken, ok?  baby, close your eyes when you’re pumping iron.  don’t let them see you falter when you choose  what kind of grip/stance to take. boykid/babygirl,  you’ve got cheekbones like a movie scene, like  the Eiffel Tower crumbles into where your lap  just was & now the whole world knows why  the bad-mouth taste felt almost reunion-like.  POST-INTERIM SUSPENSION     kid, i think the only way to get them  to stop chasing you  is to let yourself          / get caught. under the socks i have stuffed it into, the knife  sits, obvious in its silence, like my lover’s cock    under her tights, and the TSA agent, gloved  hands and careful rifle, rolls her eyes when i    try to explain. sometimes, when i’m in public  with people i love, i wonder what we look like.    soft boys/ugly girls/faces unbruised until the  cis man’s hands panic and suddenly we just    look like headlines. months ago, i took all the  knives out of my pockets and my girl and i    gulped each other until her roommates  banged on the bathroom door, begged us    to unsheath somewhere else– wincing  her cock towards my mouth, she asked    my body to answer her’s in a language  we invent each time we scramble    out of our old skins– an added week of  estrogen/each stitch i accidentally scratch    out of my masectomied chest. now, in  the airplane bathroom, my chest-scars    glow bloody and blue. i spread my thighs  and drool for a blurry cell-phone photo i will    send my partner when we land. everyone  i love wants to know why i didn’t feel safe    enough surrounded by someone else’s  weapons to leave my own behind. why risk    my white privilege being drowned out  by my trans-body. because i am taking    nudes in the sky, in a gender neutral bathroom  big enough to coffin me according to    the government’s safety standards.  maybe if i am killed, this is the photo    my funeral will PowerPoint grotesquely.  look, here is a bathroom i pissed and    cried in and did not have to wait until i was  alone to emerge and wash my hands. MY PARTNER WHO IS LEARNING HOW TO TEND A GUNSHOT WOUND     looks me in the mess and holds it  [looks at all this wound and still holds me]    when i arrive in their city i trail behind  me [and try to hide by stuffing  into my mouth] this whole week with  bloody gums [which   makes me a clumsy  kisser] but my partner who asks me how  much water i drank today  [every day] still tells me i’m cute.  my partner with the high voice  and wide wrists promises to bring me  [my ex’s head in their teeth / or,  a hundred cop-scalps / or,] breakfast.    when i leave, the middle-schoolers  outside my job won’t stop yelling  faggot like the concrete’s never had  that shit bounce off and shard  against it before. i was faggot when  i was 13 and i am still faggot now  and scared these children will see my face  remember a faked-out punch swung  into my gay-ass laugh like an adult i trust  has just told me i look like a boy with  my hair like that. and so what. this is america  and we kill anyone who we think would  look better inside-out. by america i mean    my partner [who is learning how to tend  a gunshot wound] and i both flinch at fire-  booms and the click of a chain-link  fence in the wind. we have never met  most of the people we each also love.  we both own steel-toed boots and know  how to tie a bandana as protection [or  tourniquet]. on the fourth of july we both  have pending criminal charges and this  is america, so i get cat-called  to my car, but again, this is where we are  supposed to be proud of from.  by from i mean tonight, and until  every dead kid’s name is the loudest  riot-siren of the century. so we can  still drink moonshine in the tall grass  and eat potato salad with our  hands and put everything [but  the camera-click] on pause.  the first time my roommate sees me after i’m  released from jail,        i’m drunk. so i tell her.  i know, she says. your face is all red.    //    during the Roaring 20’s popular rise of eugenics,  those declared feebleminded whom the local mental  institutions did not have room for were sent  to jail               instead.  according to varying and often contradictory  medical definitions of the time, to be feeble  minded is to display a lack of morals , to be  a creature not energetic enough to forestall  its own expectant death .         [in jail, my  cellmates tell me the week before i got there,  some girl in the next room over          hung herself  like a fuckin movie, like these female guards  didn’t even flinch and they’re still making  bitches             sleep there. ]    //    in jail, everyone misses            liquor. some  girl i don’t know and won’t after puts her  whole body next to mine and withdrawal  shakes and i tell her to stop apologizing.  even the toothpaste is alcohol             free.  i mention it’s the same toothpaste we got  in the               mental hospital. figures,  someone says. ‘sall government supplied.    //    the jail doctor asks me if there’s any history  of mental illness in my family.            [ yes.  in the beginning, there was a bottle and my grand-  father married her and so according to Mendelian  genetics, the drunkard gene can lay dormant in  my mother’s blood and still emerge in my face  // or, yes. in the beginning, my mother tried  to raise me right. but then someone asked her  what kind of creature lived in her house and  she did not have the energy to fight anymore so  she sent me to therapy instead. // or]    //    i ask my parents about            their parents  and they can only give me names with folklore.  your grandma was raped published.  Grandpa George loved his bottle  telescope.  they would’ve been so scared proud  of you. [i know my own genealogy as  a forest cut down and rotting.  if my lineage’s faults never made a sound  to me, how did i hear them anyway?  if i die by my own feeble mind blood ,  who will the coroners blame?  if a trans kid drinks a bottle of wine  and still drives home, why did no-one  make a sound to stop them?  if i order three drinks in front of my  mother and she pays for them without  saying anything, who will talk when i  fall? if a forest rots,  is it the fault of the roots or the  environment? if i am in  jail for              speaking up, whose  hands               are over my                 mouth?]    //    during the height of the eugenics craze,  thousands of feebleminded badmorals people  were sterilized against their will by the force of  the United States government. medical records  show that perhaps the majority all of these people  were just impoverished or uneducated or other-  wise not listened to when they           spoke.    //    the first time i hear my mother’s voice  after i’m released from jail, it’s clear  she’s been        crying. just tell me the truth,  she says. just tell me you’re                 innocent.

A MAN TELLS ME HOW DIFFICULT MY BODY IS     to look at. to stitch and pull into  all the beautiful shapes he can imagine.  he tells me I am azure. I am organized  and glowing. taking up so much space  with my skin and limbs. he must be  an enthusiast of the female body. he must  know the tightness of metal on my back.    he breathes near me and says what a struggle  your body must be and his words are liquid steel.  slippery as beetles. the bluffs on the north edge  of the town are black and jagged. the walleye  swarm in the deep clear water. this is the biggest  lake. the largest sea of ice. it is an excellent  customer of space. of taking ships and people  and trees and roads and swallowing them whole.    I want to tell the man than no one has touched me for three years.  maybe this is a lie. maybe this is the struggle he speaks of. maybe  he looks at my neck like lake superior looks at boats made of wood  and men. I know I am obvious. I know I am not small or easy to throw  from a dock.    to look at.  imagine  the shapes.  azure and organized.  my skin—  an enthusiast.  metal.  a beetle,                                        struggling.  liquid and    jagged. a  swarm of          space  and water.    swallowed whole.  no one.  a lie.                                               a struggle,  again. my neck,  obvious.    I am not  easy. It is not uncommon for one of us to read The Daily while we all sit around before dinner service in our chef whites and server blacks sharing a pot of pasta/red sauce or last night’s braised lamb special repurposed as a shepherd’s pie or fried rice and announce that yesterday someone jumped off Lower Yellowstone Falls in front of all the tourists or that over the weekend a guy called the police department reporting a dead body in the Cache Creek parking lot only to hang up the phone and be the one to shoot himself in the head or that last night the baker from the pub was found by his wife hanging in his garage and it turns into that discussion of would you rather die by fire or drowning starved to death or mauled by a grizzly and I pick drowning or mauled by a grizzly, although I think dying with a whole bunch of strangers in a natural disaster or plane crash is somehow comforting and I don’t tell them this or that I have thought about it and I would never choose somewhere so public like Lower Yellowstone Falls but somewhere far out of sight away from a road, but I realize that if it really is that far out of sight away from a road I would have to walk and I would have to carry water and food to sustain myself long enough to die and how could I ever choose what provisions to bring because hell if PB & J on a plain bagel is my last meal, but it can’t be something too good like a Reuben because that might make me want to stay, still after they tell us tonight’s specials at line-up, I will ask if any of it contain nuts shellfish dairy or gluten because I don’t want anyone to die in my section tonight.  Every appliance wears a little garment in my friend’s kitchen. J sews them herself, snug quilted dresses for the coffee maker and the electric can-opener. Why? It could be modesty, a qualm about displaying all those orifices and functional bits. But my guess is she wants them to feel warm and safe, all alone in the night kitchen with only the muttering fridge for company.  When she was nine they took her to Saint Paul to put her in the iron lung. The polio kids were all in a big room with their gaping machines like cattle in their stalls, and like cattle, they were left by themselves at night.  When the nurse turned out the light and shut the door, the smaller kids began to cry, and J, as trapped as they were, wondered what to do. I would have been thinking, Somebody get me out of here , or, Who will shut them up so I can sleep?  But she began to sing–a hymn, something Lutheran that she knew they’d know (this was Minnesota, this was 1952), “A Mighty Fortress Is Our God” or “What a Friend We Have in Jesus.” One by one, other children joined her.  I picture them now, singing themselves to sleep night after night in the polio barn, week after week, spinning around Earth’s axis, around the sun, around the great black hole of the galactic core, in a nearly-endless nested spiral tangle; it’s all so intricate, so completely fucked.  In my kitchen late at night, the toaster and the rice cooker face the darkness naked. Mom said she dreamt of little girls  while I was just a guppy  nestled in the crook of her pelvis, curled  in on myself, shy from before I was  even a real thing, not  ready for the world to know  me yet. She never dreamed  I’d become this massive; ghost,  guttural scream at the foot of her bed,  depression nestled like a dead fish  in my gut. Always been too big  for my own selfishness. Woman in the glass  house grows to fill the space  she’s put in, is made of paper  and bones and spitfire. Born  to be contained, held  together with iron and glue. The artist  (her mother) adds another layer. She grows.  She is kneeling, always,  even in art she must be naked, crouched,  miniature, Lady Homunculus. Here,  in the glass jar, distilled air, thick  with vanilla, she becomes  herself. i touched another ocean today, love – let it filter between my nail -bed shorelines & its sediment stuck, stubborn, the way a lover’s residue stains & warms the wrong man’s bare skin –    *  i want to tell you of a borderless love i found you at the intersection of 5 countries, horizons effervescent & bleeding into each other here, there is enough history for the both of us, lovers landlocked & gasping, i mean to say, what is love if not an intertwining of blood lines    *  i left my heart in a sea-glass sepulture & called it         home, fell in love with the brief resurrection of it all – the shatter & echo of an empty tomb God left us in – have you heard the good news? have you seen your savior in the streets today – empty palmed            & bleeding?    *  i don’t have trouble with commitment – i just don’t know when i’ll find love again, so here i am: caught between two lands not country enough to be home & neither could ever love me back –    *  Love – do not tell me of the bodies you parted to get here, i know men get lost in the wholeness of you & forget the histories & the bodies you swallowed to pave your ivory –    *  you are not the God i pray to nor the mountain & temples that robbed Him of his history – neither barbed-wire eyebrow or cement jawline, yours is a separation unwritten, undressed –    paradise stolen – paradise reclaimed –    *  & what of the breathless martyrs – the ones who tasted & trusted your waters before it filled their lungs?    once, a lover asked, “how do you see the ocean?” & i meant to say, “i don’t” or “only home – ”    i meant to say,  isn’t living  for your country  just a slower way  to die? My body is a flag across the table.  I am spreading my legs because  this is what women do. My body  isn’t sure it wants to  carry this, but my body has been bleeding  for two months, a period of patriotism,  though my colors run.  From above, what you see are three women  in a room, two fully clothed, one in a paper  gown on a table. The one in a paper  gown is a flag, her feet in metal stirrups.  What she doesn’t know is tomorrow.  What she doesn’t know is how many of us  there are until we all show up.  A woman holds the device to slip inside me,  to stop the bleeding, to stop the babies,  to offer the progesterone my body  is refusing to make. My body is a flag woven  in the metaphysics of bleeding. How to sew  a perfect woman. How to hem  a menstrual flow. In my paper gown,  the doctor tells me there may be a little pain   for next four years ,  while the nurse comforts—her hand  on my arm while another woman inserts  her hand, a speculum, the device,  inside me. My body is a ragged flag,  worn but still flying. 1998 was about pretending to be brave at the counter  with the box of pads  (and I still hate that word pads  hate how it feels in my mouth  hate saying hey do you have a pad?  hate how it looks on a grocery list  so much that I write etc . next to tampons )  but I buy pads.     And in 1998 I pretended to be so brave  and I would drop that box        on the counter  and look the cashier right in the eye and he or she  (and hopefully she)  would ring up my pads              (because I was afraid of tampons)  with my lipstick and gum and magazine  (because you never buy just pads)       and gently hand over the cash.  1998 was about      I am not       one of those girls         who is afraid  to buy pads because       for fucks sake       I am not the only girl  who has ever had a period      I am not the only woman  who has needed a pad.  And yet I trembled and my voice pitched higher I said thank you  and I lost my breath      when the cashier was a man    and was it worse  if it was a boy or a man ?      And all of these fucks I gave away like  coins into the register      for medical necessities          that we  are skulking about in      that      aisle       trying to pick out  because some of the tampons    are all slick packaging  and some promise period days with white bathing suits  and we   don’t    want     to be here    and we don’t but  this is where we protect the unease of what bodies do.  It’s what bodies do.      And it’s 2017         and I empty my basket  of pads pads and tampons      and whatever else  onto the counter       and I think I might even  be flirting with this cashier  who is ten years younger than me  because he’s cute     and I want to      and I’m so out of fucks  to give       over a bunch of cotton        to stuff  in my cooter  and here       I have jumped the fuck shark. I’m pretty confident in claiming that I tell the best ghost stories. Not just the one about how a pair of bulldozers knocked down my childhood bungalow in thirty five minutes. Nor the tale of what my mother really kept in the locked jewelry box. I learned pretty early that everyone was dirty, but in different ways. Most locks were dirty, too.   Let’s imagine we are stuck in an elevator together. When I was a kid, Dutch elm disease ravaged the neighborhood. That was before crack. Now every time I ride an elevator I think of the story my uncle told about the glass eye. It had a tiny witch inside the artificial pupil. That story wasn’t scary. I’m not sure where he found the bloody handkerchief.   You might sneer at the idea of a haunted rope, but you won’t be laughing when your car teeters at the edge of a ravine, and all you have is dental floss to secure your bumper. Sometimes during sex I whisper where’s my golden arm? So far only one man has caught the allusion. I turned him into a majestic sugar maple, and frequently picnic in his shadow.   One late afternoon we both looked out the window and said oh my god . And then we vanished like the hitchhikers that we were. We abandoned our figurative jackets in the back seat of the proverbial car. Swore each other off, and then fell off the wagon within the same night. My building was an elevator building, yours a primitive walk-up.   Are the minutes themselves haunted, or is that our fault? You might remember the apex of our love affair to be the time you had to employ olive oil to get duct tape out of my bangs. I might consider it our first trip to the broken fountain. We looked into the water and saw the reflection of our stooped, aged selves. They were complete strangers to each other. Can you believe it: I used to stay up past eleven. I could sleep like a drawer of clean socks. Wait until noon to eat my assortment of suspicious fruits. The sky was a moldy cabbage. We talked on things connected to walls, had brief dreams about swings. The kids in the park threw sliced bread at anything that moved, including the wind. I swear the water lapped right up to the grass, so if you were distracted by a book you’d get wet really fast. Because of the lake. And we spoke so infrequently about generations, though I knew mine was renowned for its hard living, which I took to be a difficulty, such as the way every drug mart store had a separate job application with subtle differences, so you had to rewrite it every time you applied. I had a midnight shift selling gin. I was eighteen with a red crew neck under my polyester vest. We were allowed no embellishments. The other day I stopped by a drug mart and the cashier had a leather vest with fringe and a unicorn in sequins on the back. That job involved too much math. The sky was an obnoxiously long receipt with too few items. I wanted to tear it in half. The roommate in the skit was a sock full of marbles. My roommate was a throbbing model of the city we lived in at the time, which was neither famous nor consistently referenced in statistics. Both of these things have changed. Our breakout session focused on frequently asked questions. Nobody particularly liked this symposium, except for making out in alleys afterwards and drinking impermeable clear liquors in joints where for liability reasons they made you down a shot of buttermilk before walking through the door. And now, over a decade later, those same joints are being firebombed by kindergartners and the breakout sessions are on explosives in the classroom. I told my roommate about the time I arrived extra early to class so I could shave my legs, and found shell casings in the corner of the classroom, and at the time that was unusual. My roommate only cared about what kind of razor. The apartment in the skit contained typical artifacts of a mop closet. The hose made me super uncomfortable, but maybe it was razor burn. This was before my roommate and I declared all our ointments to be open access. During the announcements, the announcer noted that a major motion picture would soon be filmed on campus. My roommate munched loudly on a few slices of frosted banana bread. I viewed that film seventy times, hoping for a glimpse of my bare legs under a tablet desk. There’s nothing more sacred than a roommate, one of the actors in the skit declared, but this was clearly an ad lib, since we attended a public university where you couldn’t say anything was sacred. How the train tracks veer away from me the tremendous bellies of the grain holders and their side-wined staircase and how it makes me believe magic exists, the dry   grass coming up through the abandoned cement abandoned always abandoned since before they were ever there, the small yield. The majestic symmetry of the crop row, the orange, the alfalfa, the walnut, the corn, the grape   teaching the famers minds and the workers hands how to handle their laws and their skin, how to be so afraid of their absence which is the same, as loves’ eyes closed. I know how the silt left dry at the bottom of an irrigation ditch   keeps itself, lays down low and huddles in. I know the water truck the sun washed teal of the hammered metal body. I know Levis heard birds and thought about the spirit, the name of the knot inside of each and every presence somehow strung   together like a single breath— I know the oil trains going by like my own heart, the ragged climbing and falling, stopping and jerking, the graffiti a present from each little gangbanger who doesn’t know they’re an artist in my life. I know the single house built   like an oasis in the middle of vines, the imported palm trees, the long clean driveway like a road to somewhere through nowhere. The power station of transformers, the avenues, the graveled shoulder of the road, the dairy cows and their short dirty lives already   behind them. When my arms are open the dirt scuttles beneath my nails like sea creatures. I know somewhere beyond that row of Eucalyputus resembles a river. I know the Trump signs are the people I never saw living here and   the reason I stay teaching myself, so I can come back to them with a gift that bursts. I know the F150, the chrome lights, the racing stripe, the rims are the pride I feel when I say Fresno. I say Fresno every day to keep mind clean,   my breath swept, my sky cottoned my gravel loose my roads veering my grass growing even when dying or dead my rows straight my rows straight my rows leading me forward, which is sometimes the same thing as backwards,   which is sometimes the same thing as pride, which is sometimes the same thing as afraid. I know I will die here. I know the chain link around the water pump, the electrical poles like thousands of crosses   erected in my heart and this valley is the dirt planting each of them. I know the coyotes howl, the sunset call, the horizon disappearing behind the line showing me how to draw myself above it.  Mother, today’s grass raises up to reach me and your body underneath its dying and also its birth folds itself like a perfect blanket.  Each towel in our house was a perfect square of day, a bath, a dream, a piece of toast, and I laid them corner over corner to please you  in the absence of children. Mother, I feel your cross eyes, your necessity for control over the small and universal by trimming  the string from each blouse, each dishrag so that not even cotton undoes. Nothing breaks here. Even your cry I can hear between clouds.  The sun slaps down each call as I address you and stare into what I am afraid I’ll never see again. Every ghost story is a love story ,  a famous, white, male writer once said. He never said a thing about hate. The soul is a bride    I have fallen a long way.  My red and blue zeppelin drags itself up and over the harbor. What would the dark do without my naked mouth, red and awkward.  What to do with such beautiful blank, but kill it.  I have taken a pill to kill the mermaids and two legged dream girls.  I call them orphans, but as orphans, they are ill.  I do not flinch.    ~    The tiny toy wife    Inside the church, he does not smile or smoke.  The bride flowers are full of holes. They trickle and stiffen in my hair. I love him like history, but I am only 30.  I carpenter a space for the things I am given, but the babies drop from a terrible altitude, arrive through the mail slot with a loving familiarity.    ~    Nevertheless—    All night, I carpenter a space for the owl heads, the fox heads, the heads of dead rabbits.  I am so stupidly happy. I kill what I can, and confess everything.  My naked mouth red and awkward, my black on black. I break and the mouth breaks.  Burns blue and expels a freshness, a vacancy. I blow my tubes like a bad radio.  Shatterproof.  Proof. Her cottage shingles painted w/ dollar store vamp nail polish a stack of ceramic eggs pillars an awning  I stand outside for ten minutes see the door open so I go in  The place has three rooms: a bedroom a kitchen/toilet combo a room w/ a door shut— (maybe it’s a walk-in closet but who knows)  Everything in her bedroom is made of glass but lacks a view  Her bed has no blanket her pillows covered in translucent cloth made from the outer layer of human palms  I sit on a chair by her dresser I become too conscious  the fact of my body unsinkable unsoften against these furnishings  A woman walks in calls herself Helen throws a camo jacket on her mattress If  this is beauty then count me out  her left arm skin hinges like gills her tendons all out flap softly in time w/ her breath  her sternum cut into as if someone went ice-fishing for her heart  her right cheek flayed like butchered pig the cheekbone juts when she speaks to me  She asks if she can have like, five minutes She lays on her bed, stomach side down—  a traffic circle of veins & sinew a city of spoil -ed meats stretch and flap over glass       Upended ruptured sky and clean burst of lung. Urgent striation beyond reckoning. Beyond borders that pray. Beyond gods that watch. Beyond hollow hands pushing asylum. This too will meet you. Say nothing. This too will condemn.   They will take you to the ground. Act like it is home. Meet it with longing and cry out: mother of dogma, black-draped sanctuary, the missing has been a mountain.   They will lock the door. Squat jaws loom, chipped with tributaries of disaster. Fat wrists painted red. There will be old knees that tell stories back to front. This is one of them.   There will be another. And it will buckle. Now shield your face. Bury your eyes up to the black and remember the girl caught plastic forever, skin emptied of every scar. My Benedictine Sister says it’s hard not to be Judas-minded. I ask her if she means betrayal.  No, not that, she says, everyone betrays. Remember the broken perfume bottle? How Mary wipes her Lord’s feet  with her hair? It’s Judas who reminds the crowd how many bellies might’ve been filled by selling her perfume.  It’s Judas who sees only suffering, recognizes no value in anointing— when there’s so much work  to be done. Mary shows us beauty’s got no mother in this world, save those who anoint.  Sister Eunice tells me suffering wins when we look away from the broken bottle. I tell her, I am glad poets  waste what’s beautiful. It is good to own a good many things, at least soap.  To own the ice cream in your hand. To wash  your hands if there is money for it. To split  apart a cone in your hands if you hold  it too tight with feeling, and the wafer soaks  and you bite into it and there is ice  cream and what wafer is made up of.  Your teeth feel it all. You say to me  that it is time, you want to see the streets  your grandfathers now dead grew up in,  or la embajada maybe, the cemetery, and also  Coppelia, the heladería built after they were born,  fled (but before they died), to see the  ice cream there and to taste it— yes in the sixties  it was desired to have more ice cream flavors  than the United States, because that is important,  and important to try out: ice cream, milk,  sugar, whatever few flavors available, maybe  sugar cane, you who have never cut it  but you know others in Miami who had.  You drank sugar cane juice at supermarkets  growing up and taught yourself to like it.  Those cannons you desire to hear announcing  themselves in the Havana morning, not for  Cubans now, it’s for visitors like you who go visit,  and for those ghosts of grandfathers now dead,  but I don’t know if when they die they cross  the ocean or if they only tolerate  the feel of democracy and peninsulas.  If you want the exile to wither,  then it is good your grandparents do not own you,  the young can never be the same as the old in any case—  the ones who would forbid you,  you who have never seen the mystery,  or tasted anything at all, and all  for the grandfathers now dead whose ghosts  may be political, and you say you want  to taste the flavor of ice cream.  Are ghosts, or humans, more politically minded?  What do you care for when you die?  What are the flavors telling you? quick-like the girl pedals her yellow bike in the road wants so much to go so far  the weasels undo the mouse nest under the porch and the mother slides her fingers between hinge and doorjamb open shut open shut  what a lot of loneliness to make up for in a half-swing  mothers know some things best so the girl pedals back home her knees bloody  even though she hasn’t fallen neveronce she’s got a lot of riding to do yet the boys in the street call her a name or something more  guttural they find a skinny dog behind the houses the alley does a no-good job of hiding  they pull on its tail and the howl makes the weasels run out mother loosens her blouse her fingers are a lovely shade of her favorite color  this time the girl leaves her bike against the side of the house and the boys are mean but pretend to be nice the dog howls  yanked like the cord on a basement light bulb  oh what the girl wouldn’t give to crawl into her mother’s bed she finds a penny in the street slicked with piss places her hand over her heart  in god we trust in god we trust. My father leaves  money on the kitchen counter  whenever I visit.  A check for school.  Fifty for gas,  but my liver takes the cash.  Before my father’s birth,  my grandfather is a boy,  stung metal of a Nazi  coin in his hand.  He loved collecting  money. His book of  war occupation dollars,  labels ISREAL, JAP, FILPNO  on every page. His heart  caught in that 1940s yellow.  I love money.  I too keep euros  and pfennigs,  even the bitter silvers.  Our family a money tree.  How I spend enough bile  for the three of us. I had a rabbi once.  He played guitar  and sang,  and he is singing far away  from my dead town.  I had a pope once.  I liked his Instagram pics,  wore a rosary on my wrist.  I had a god once.  He tried to make me  more than I was,  which is nothing.  All I am is a history of men.  The marble and blood.  I had a father.  He gave me ash, heart  problems, cathedrals.  I can’t escape  the hallelujahs.         A blue scarf can’t cover the hickey exploding  eggplant across my neck – and when I haven’t met  his eye in days, not able to shake the snakes    from my face when I see him, he invites me  for coffee. It will only get worse if I delay –  he persists, coiling like acid    in my stomach. When we meet,  he’s bewildered by my apathy,  clutches his love for me. I’m an argument    he thinks he can win – how a body  can be got and once gotten,  the heart with it. But I only said ‘yes’    because you say ‘yes’ when you are oceans away  from home and he has already started anyway –    His fingers coddle his cup of tea, as if  they’re delicate, not strong enough  to bruise. I cord out the words:    we’re better as friends . Any explanation  but the real one. He tells me I’m confused,  will surely come around.    He is patient.  I stare at the bagel by his elbow, his wiry  body still grunting in my head.    I crave the exit  that doesn’t come and never comes  even when we walk out the door. I’m driving your pickup  through the back roads    no idea where I’m going and you  are high, ranting greasefire    you turn to me, oxen dead  in your eyes, am I dead    I have to collar you  as you open    your door  to fly into blackness    I feel we’re shucking off  it’s just you and me and we    are alone together  you, hollow worms    me, still loving like the dirt  of the North Carolina roads I let    wander us home one hand  on the wheel the other    twisted into your red t-shirt  and we are both    screaming, I am so certain  you need me    I never slow down  the night sky    yawns over your pickup  summer bugs hum with the tires    there is nothing in the pines  or in the crosshatched stars    I expect the next morning  will bring you  back    you rattle around the apartment  leaving me    the open door  saving you was not    enough I am gutsick  due North. My body remembers itself distantly, humming while I pick out soap, detergent, floor cleaner and scouring sponges. I do not want to hear stories about my body while I am shopping to strip my house of dirt, praying for that future of mint clean and green to seep into me. Then — its blow made of black and silvery fists, pain appears, in aisle 5. A story that my body tells me in the highest pitched sound, a crushing warble and hiss, hunching me over the shopping cart saying: Listen to me. No, do not even try to squeeze out the sound & crush of lungs and muscles and throat, its crumbling paper wad. You don’t want to write this opera, conduct my scratchy song? Deal with it. I stand mute. I stand mute. I stand mute.    Every aisle fills with water. I float to pain, rise to its surface, a blubbery body. I am made into its throne, its trap door. Terrifying, this surrender to a creature born out of me. And all I wanted was a simple child with a face, hands and four limbs. Instead, monstrous and beautiful, hitched to my hip in grand deformity, I am its compulsory guardian and servant. I’m afraid of its living with the same intensity as I am afraid of losing my own biological children. It knows what I am capable of doing in my mind. I am afraid this pain is tethered to that see-saw of chutes and black holes hiding in my neurons, it’s circuitous maze that leads back to something I always but can’t find.    I clutch to the shopping cart bar, its metal grip: Holy mother of Medrol-pack steroids albuterol morphine codeine anti-inflammatory antibiotics methotrexate infusions and all its viles and IV altars. I want to cut out this sickness out of my body and bury its bones, its scattering of calacas rooted in the city of my chest. Give me the knife. I will be the surgeon. I want to look at this Beast — I want to see what it feels like in my quivering palm. Breathe out in a whistle. What small thing commands so much from me and pretends so arrogantly that I am not at its mercy. Breath in and shut my eyes to how it turns me into a sopping dishrag while I am reading to my son, washing my daughter’s hair. A prison of Holy Here and Now, this nightmare made of stitched flesh, fur and infant’s feet, my terrible lithopedion, please do not make me your mother. Please for this next breath. I do not know how to turn away a child but I will. Blow out, slowly, relax grip on the cart’s bar. Accept now that my body, our bodies, are the weep holes of the Universe to which it pours itself through. Breathe into all of it gushing, the tiny cracks opening foundation, the dry walled skeleton pulsing with sacred knowledge. Let it pour, let it crack. Feel this dervish of pulling, as I resist its gravity with all the force I can. Pay for the groceries. Pick up the children. Feed them. Comfort them. All the crackling in the background, bringing me to sit by my son’s bed at night and we sing, we sing, me, my baby and that dark surge. It is a holy sound, a broken choir of three. Before Scheele, all manmade green faded to a dull brown. Outdoors, the green of lime, moss, shamrock. Green of the deep sea & sea kelp. Mint & myrtle, pine & tea. But inside only the dreary sun-bleach of nettle, leek, birch. The whole world burst each spring with a green so bright it made even the white folks forget the coming summer fevers. & though those greens would never last, we longed to be such bright lit things. To swing in emerald dresses. Dine in rooms of forested fern. So what’s a little arsenic? A dead cow or two who grazed the green grass near Scheele’s discarded water. Soon all the world bloomed with Paris green. Wallpaper men licked their bottle green wallpaper to prove it was safe. Little Johnnies ate hard candy the color of a city not yet invented in Oz. Scarletts wore green curtains after the war to remind themselves of better times.  Everyone just mad with green. Olive candles flickered in the night, air sparked with poison. Green butcher paper to wrap fresh cut mutton, green stamps to send news & gossip to those in a place spring hadn’t yet touched. A green so rich never mind the shits. Headache & nausea would send the sweeping mistress to her room to dream of fairy wings & lily pads & the four leaf clovers of home. The dream-green of calves, the last green of the little exiled emperor. The envy-green of Carl Sheele gasping his last breath, body diseased by a lifetime of tasting his work. Borax’s green burn. How his printer had dawdled with his treatise on fire-air long enough for someone else to discover oxygen. Verdigris green of sturdy French women scraping wine soaked copper. He vowed this would never happen again. Made sure to put his name on the green that colored the west for over a hundred years. Verona green of crushed clay still clinging to the walls of Pompeii. Green of hope, of permission. The only color a new bud refuses to carry, & the green green of our long wanting. Arsenic could be mistaken for  flour in the bread, sugar dissolved  at the bottom of a cup. A little  laudanum for the baby who cries  and cries, and always grows    into the same as them— no matter  the song she sings or how  many nights she nurses him  to sleep. A sprinkling of strychnine  in the beans, a teaspoon    of bedbug poison as practice.  What a woman could do alone  in the kitchen when no one was  looking. A quick risk, sleight  of hand. But she’d planned this    for months. Years really. Since  that first time she knew her worth  in this world. Both nothing and  so much at once. Her chin too  defiant, her hand trembling    when she ladled the clear gravy  soup she worked at day and night.  Skimming the fat, seasoning it  just so. Or before that— when  she couldn’t remember because    she knew to bury it without ever  being told. Like she knew the guns  would always be locked up, a fire  could be snuffed out in time.  The oven always too damned hot    for anyone but her and the Lord.  And the Lord knew full well  why she had to. Else He wouldn’t  have made the powder so white  or her broth taste so good. You tell me where in midheaven Gemini is and I think of Copernicus,  the formation of stardusted planets fitting  in his mind like pins in a lock. You draw my birth chart,  map the shape the cosmos took as it swirled over my first breath,  my mother’s beaded forehead and her stinging pelvic bone.   Sun in Aries , you say, moon  in Libra, the game of jacks  the stars play each time I leave something and go back  searching for it: a lost diamond on a dark street. When I was baptized,  my father insisted the priest lower me three times into holy water –  the liquid muteness of hydrogen and oxygen, the organ’s wasp nest  breaking each time I surfaced. You tell me that Venus and Neptune  are conjuncting and I should stay on axis and follow my muse  and I think of how I leapt from the pool before the whole congregation and no one knew  if it was because I was full of the Lord or I couldn’t wait to leave him.  The constellation Libra hangs in space above the moon-damp clouds.  The starred horns of Aries extend from the vernal equinox into the bones  of my fingers, my heart cut from muscle and adaptation,  muscle’s oneness with blood. You tell me what gods I’m ruled by  and I think none , I think all, I think of my mother’s DNA opening itself  at the seams, the chaotic act of breath rising from little more  than this. “who mothers the mothers who tend the hallways of mothers”-Catherine Barnett    The breasts are a temporary food source. I am a starved city.  I held my daughter, grey, curled into a comma. Her hair caught fire in the hospital lights.  Someone said this isn’t normal. Babies don’t scream this much. Someone said breastfeeding is best. Someone broke. Someone explained dehydration. A heart attack. Asystole. I said amen. Amen. Amen.  And still, the doors open. And still, the night comes. And still, the terror of headlights stream past the passenger side of the car. And still, the babies in other cars.  Men are broken by less.  I offer her cremated body to the lake. I offer the night our gods. I offer myself to mothers. Others.  The mouth. The eye. The nipple. To the dark gathering like children in the corners of the room. To the children in the corners of the room still breathing. I remember—,	those who die a little at my breast everyday. Those who survive like a city on fire.  I used to pray a lot growing up, this baby afraid of what remains,  the heavy dark. Dark shadow’s breath breathing back  from every corner of the room. The dark things that tease sleep, when  mother’s prayers, whispered and handwritten offerings I could press to my chest,  the willpower of words soaked in blood for the round body, the heart  that circulates, and becomes invisible in the dark of nightmares. My mother’s prayers  an offering on my tongue, a giant apple— One night forgotten, I woke halfway, a snake  bite on my leg. I watched mother wipe blood off my two-pin piercing.  In the morning I woke up with no wound, nor scar. Father said it all happened in my head.  Mother prayed, her handwritten prayers wrinkled beneath my pillow,  their crinkles said, I will tell and tell it so much until it stops making sense.  And I wonder how god will understand what falls between her teeth,  what lands puréed on my tongue, what is still being swallowed. Hours before Hurricane Irene,  a man sells roses on Annapolis road.  Armageddon flowers.    Every storm is a disaster  when you grew up  with a Y2K Mom.    On instinct, I buy  stock canned foods  when buying bras at Kmart.    The sky goes grey:  I charge my phone  & fill the bathtub    with emergency water.  There are days I despise  my apocalyptic inheritance.    Other days I hold it  to my chest like  a security blanket.    My mother taught me  to be prepared, plan ahead,  always have Ritz crackers    in your purse just in case.  My mother doesn’t think  that she’s afraid: only    sensible. I like to  think I’m different than  my mother, but all of us    carry our mothers  around our necks  like Polly Pocket lockets    whether we want to or not:  pull them out, play without  knowing what our hands are doing.  We remember, boys left behind and buried.  We will not speak of war, but we will sing of the dead, how they dance in our ribs.  We will unbury their memory, replace them with all the arms still lying around.  I don’t want to see a single Kalashnikov in sight.  Rather, I want to see boys, dancing, given lipstick and kohl, told to paint the town any shade that fits.  As we stand on this sacred sand, I want to say a prayer for our buried boys. Let us untangle their bodies from bloodied flags, lower them back to the loving  ground, let them sleep, if only for once. green as spring as mint leaves swirling in dark  red green black  I want no flags in my tea no fags in my teeth  swirl me around, I want to dance with my country  give her a dress whatever she likes whatever fits or doesn’t but I will come back with all the paper you can possibly  imagine we will fold them into every story we’ve ever needed  hang them like on a cold Ramadan night.  when i say yall dont move like we do      i’m mainly talking about the walls of our cafeteria and how they dripped with the sweat of teenagers let free once a year to move our bodies however we wanted and the speakers lived right next to where they served jerk chicken on wednesdays but the only things moist and edible here were the lips of the same girl that sat in front of me in economics with her hair in an afro and the lure of shea butter filling my nose and the whole cafeteria was a shea butter dancefloor where boys would lock hips with the curved side of a girl and we‘d sway like the tapered end of an impatient flame until the cafeteria looked like it was burning and my sister said the burning turned into a paradise when she swung her hips on top of the boy she snuck into her room while Grammy was out front making a banquet out of the dead thing Granddaddy brought home and back then Grammy said jesus ain’t fond of anything that happens after 10PM but we all knew she pulled thirteen trembling lives from her own body so there must have been more to this story swimming in her head whenever she tapped her finger to the sound of the calypso.   i know we all succumb to a rhythm at some point but perhaps i’m wrong. i’d play you some music from the homeland but i don’t want to be disappointed. i am here, anyway, saying what i have always known to be true: all roads lead to hell or a rapture.  love does not want this body      and when i say body i mean country. this severed land once and then twice removed. first i mean the mist and then i mean the wind.   when i say love i do mean God. i do mean heaven and its bar of entry. i do mean whatever takes a hold of us as we lower our people into their graves.   i could say:  a grave can become its own kind of country but then i am just speaking again of my people and our fleeing. how we were made to bleed and then made a nation out of dying.   how tricky this makes the word lineage. i am not sure where i come from anymore. maybe it’s the sea. i know there was once a shore line and then there was me, a wet and deathless child.   i think unzipping the path from the country you are in to the country in which you belong is all a matter of preference and by this, i do mean: if the ocean unfolds its wide arms and the tide parts its lips for this body   tell the few that i leave behind  i am finally in love. i looked at the water’s surface and saw so many reflections. She spits fierce into the dirt, palms me a goodbye. Most days, she leaves me home to paint and goes flying. The dog whines from the porch. On tall chicken legs, our house ambles in a southerly direction. Everybody has a job to do.    Me, I paint the things that don’t have names yet. Baba’s old work shirt smells like turmeric, and I have to roll up the sleeves. I smear umber and burnt sienna into owlets, minnows. Cobalt becomes horses with the longest legs. Even the wings lifting from the live oaks have a color: heron blue.    I think the pictures I make might start breathing. I paint the scalloped hen-of-the-woods I saw yesterday, leaving out the boy from school who pushed me down in the leaves, the bark-scrape.    The marsh gets loud at dusk. Tree frogs gather on the windowpane, hunting with tongues out. Baba comes home late, cooks fiddlehead ferns in a pan slick with butter. Tells me stories while acorns drop ghost-handed from the roof.    I don’t have to brush my hair if I don’t want to, but I do have to be strong, like well water, like iron. Before she claps the light out, Baba points to the crack in my ceiling: a thin red stream of ladybugs. I want to believe that what’s coming for me will be good.    The house walks itself in circles, spiny feet scratching at the red clay. I don’t call for her to come back.  I swallow the howl that lives in my mouth. Everybody I know is just a person.    When that boy finds our house, Baba will lock me inside, spit tobacco juice in his eye, grind his bones for our breakfast while the frogs scream in victory. Every creature gathers at the window, watching. The sky is permanent rose. God is calling, he says, when the phone rings. Neither of us answer.  Half-drunk, beneath a willow, at exactly 2:45 I take inventory:  the pitbull gnashing after the schoolchildren as they pass; the boy,  porch-ridden until 6pm, sharpening a stick; the man pushing  a shopping cart, black-lunged and bloated, through the intersection.  I tell him, I’m gonna give up. Andrés responds: God’s love is everlasting.  I tell him, This is my last one. I’m making myself sick.  Jesus, were he alive today, would be a homeless dude, he says.  Slowly, every breath kills me: it’s like loose gravel in my chest. My body begging.   We die with only our bad habits, he whispers,  and loving what kills us is the cruelest trick the Devil ever played .  I watch the last bits of sunlight being choked from the neon sky.  A breeze passing through the tree makes the underbellies  of the leaves iridescent. Everything in this city goes on to break us, I say.  Andrés’ body begins to shake. Although I can’t see him, I know he is crying.  In the kingdom of this city I’ve begun to hate I say, Amen. This is not you but your body forced to feign prayer. A curbside  confession: Forgive me officer, for I have sinned. On bended  knees, arms raised, hands reaching for what little you know of god,  you assume the position. Cruciform. Assume to know what you have always  assumed true: you are just one breath away from breathlessness. This is not  you but your body made brilliant in orbs of blue and red light. This is not you but  your body. Shrouded in siren-call. This is not you but your body. Last words  from your mouth unheard pleas, voice hoarse from begging before it’s holed.  Made unwhole. Your heart, like a fist, trying still to hold on. You and not your body,  blocks away. Bringing home still-warm bread beneath your arm. A bottle of glue  in your pocket, to teach your son that what’s broken can be mended. A set of brushes  in your palms, because you wanted to paint yourself in colors too brilliant for this world,  the way you deserved to be remembered, bright and untouched by the dark. Loving but bumbling. Intensely competent but emotionally distant. These are the choices. With which father would you rather go hunting? The one more likely to shoot you comically with an arrow? Or the one more likely to leave you behind for the wolves? Either way, they’re coming home empty-handed. Either way, you’ll have stories for your therapist & motivation for all of your life’s great achievements. Either way, you’ll want to follow the marked path. Stay near the trail. Wear layers. Carry a knife. Faith is always misplaced, this is the nature of faith. It seems easier to stay inside, warm by the fire, but the season turns, the children grow hungry, someone must hunt. Some comedian has a one-liner about kids  being sent here to replace us. Nothing  is funny anymore. Some comedian.  Sometimes looking at my son  is like looking in a time-traveling mirror:  me at whatever age you have to be  to think a face lasts forever.  My son is handsomer than I am,  though I’m biased in his favor,  also he’s probably a nicer person,  so an upgrade for the world in the long run,  unless I bollocks it up for him. He carries  the dank sock smell of a 12-year-old  in a hurry and I don’t get to decide  when or whether he’ll outgrow it. Time  is one of those soul-sucking office jobs  where they make you train your replacement  before they freeze your passwords  and send a security guard  to watch you pack the family photos  on your desk, escort you  from the building. There’s not much to it:  help with homework until the homework  surpasses my abilities. Play catch  until twilight, wrestle in the living  room until he beats me. The work  would be pretty straightforward  if I weren’t so emotionally attached.  I’d like to think I’d get more credit for caring  but I told you he was in a hurry. I still need  to teach him to drive, to do his own laundry,  to strike a match, so many fires still  to start, they’re asking me to come  in early this morning to talk  about the future, I’m afraid there’s no good  way to say this, they’ve decided to go  in a new direction.  Leaving The Heretic for an after-party  at Masquerade, the two of us still    wanting and awake in that city where  those who legislate such things forbid    the sale of liquor at this hour. Thus  the crush of shirtless flesh sways    numb within the pulse and surge,  forming and unforming    in circles. We separate,  each searching for something    long gone. I ask someone  at the door if we can go out    and come back in. Moonless  and starred, the night    nearly over. One of us—the one  no longer here—begins to sing    “How Soon is Now?”  You shut your mouth—  Years gathering scattered drafts,  fragments on scraps, and still  a receipt or napkin sometimes slips  from a book or box.  Just last week, this:    A kestrel fell from the sky  and took  the chickadee.  I  found a ripped wing in the field,  told you  to hold it, to feel  the resistance. Even ripped  from  the bird it grips the air.  This is how it is with us.    ***    Another scene that hounds: you  at the table we sanded and stained together,  bowed over words: swaying outside  the window behind you, assault  lilies bent red with blooms: memory,  like dream, like film, sooner or later starts  to warp, to waver: the tongues of lilies  turn to flames hell-bent on erasing  what had been written: there.    ***    Fitful sleep always does the trick,  calls you back. We separate  to throw the hunters, their husk    and skew of shadows, flashlights.  Their leashed beasts growling.  What form will your signal take:    Owl, mourning dove, wolf, hawk?  Sense of watching and being  one of the men who had been hidden,    begin to run. Of course, to each other.  Motion slowing as they draw  closer— are drawn closer?    You want to stop them though  you’ll never wake or reach them  before the deafening report, pity    of doves drumming from the wheat  again. Some dark and gleaming thing  a phone? a weapon? falls to the ground.    Slurred light. Surely, you missed  something. It couldn’t just end  like this, that shadow    slipping between them and the sun.  And us. Of course, it slipped  between the sun and us. Pressed between pages, this realistic painting  of hands, fingers curled and caked with dirt,  holding or holding-on to other hands, antiqued  and chipped like statuary, one pair in particular  outstretched like a praying set, proffering  a book, a penny, a mirror, a horror: a memory  like a recurring dream of returning  hands, yours among them in that GIF  your brother sent, a huge file that took  whole minutes to download on the ancient  computer and sketchy connection at my parents’  house in the sticks where I’d become a blown  glass figure in the sunroom window, and them  unsure how or whether to touch me, when or if  I could be left alone. Meanwhile I waited  for what I knew and didn’t know was coming.  Looking and quickly looking away. Through  the phone your brother’s voice said he’d stand  beside me, have my back. A voice that sounded  like my own spoke back. He said not to worry  about the rest of the family, what they did  or said or would or wouldn’t say.  Vowed to hold my hand through the wake,  the service in the frigid little chapel at Hall  Davis & Son Funeral Service, at least until  he rose to preach, to speak, but who  selects who’s heard, whose voice still  speaks, and who am I, uninvited, not  noted among the pallbearers, the survived-by,  and what right this ghostface like a negative  beside the all-black congregation in Baton Rouge  while outside August suffocates, wavering  toward which car, not the family, surely, and why  Lord how much more, hand-wringing and weeping,  twenty miles to Port Hudson National Cemetery,  drooping flowers suffering the heat, stunned anew  by all twenty-one blasts of the graveside salute,  the American flag draped folded and handed-  over. Not to me, though I reached. To the silent  father you last saw when you were nine.  But grief is steeped and wrenched by greed.  Each time I closed my eyes your hands reached  to hold me still. I opened them and told your brother  yes, I would meet to introduce the you he hadn’t seen  or tried to see in twenty years. I could still see you  in the photo. He wanted me to say it looked  like you again. My eyes fell from the faded  bloated hand-painted face (no longer golden,  each freckle buried under pancake) to the stiff-  collared shirt that hid the scarred neck,  down to the cuff of the new brown suit,  your folded hands laid forever over your  privates. All you had and had not done,  and by your own hand, and all the parts  (including me) unmentioned, not  at the service and never again.  The lid raised and gaping, and against  golden lining, something both you  and not you on view despite your wish  to be (written, erased, all your words) turned  to ash, scattered by my hands. Your hands  provided a place to focus until I could  summon the will the will the will to— Since some will ask about this  place called us, it looked out    on a field of sunflowers beneath green  mountains that vanished in mist.    We were convinced happiness lived  there, or somewhere like it. And weren’t we    happy there? In the gleaming kitchen  that final morning, two flawless sunflowers,    a postcard propped against the vase.  No message, or hint, just a P.S:    Retrieve. And don’t forget Love,  What saved us still saves us.    Now I know that too should  have ended with a question.   us two- a sunspot fried  a full pot of bindi  seven spices & a laughter with  all permissions special  a pair of dark wood rotting  misplaced on beach of  sands a crystal ivory  & sea a sanctioned foam  only us, chosen fires  know the work of salvage  know to take the wedge  slide it to lifeless in our  cratered mouths dense with  burden of forgotten language  heavy and uncompromising  sharp teeth of a comb escaping  into harvesters of blonde strings  raking and raking  we the in-between generation  we who love to wipe the  crisp bile of a ripe fruit  from our lips and know  in the deepest marrows  of the homeward canines  we are still  entitled to the sacred  meat of our countries  and its linger in between us  we are still the children  of its oldest trees. Night of bra straps cut from their brassieres, of wet condoms lying across on the floor. The smell of Minnesota come winter, inside a sink.  A useless paint brush bleeds pigments across the porcelain tiles, its handle splattered green from the blues and yellows lining my nailbeds.  I’ve learned even color goes bad in the light of the moon, that the cold cannot be put away, inside a body. That when a cat opens its mouth, its eyes glow brighter.  Our flesh throbs like veiny waves against a distant shore, salty, warm, & hundreds of miles from where we are.  In the clamor of the pipes I can almost hear the birds and children screeching no, as they too hold each other close. The winter my father died a girl I knew lit her hair on fire, hoping the moths would return to the elm towering outside her window and stream in towards her crown of flames.  I can’t beautify what escaped back out. She’s been appearing at my doorstep, her fists hushed in their mittens, and the frozen milk bottle across the yellow linoleum of my kitchen, weeping, while I spin like a horse before the switch is flipped.  The fat of my solitude slices thick off the bone. And in a window across the street, the television’s blue light does not dark. The girl stands on the porch, hungry, lost until I let her in. What state do we live in? What country? What is four times four? What are your favorite books? How do we each learn best? Who are your best friends? Who makes you feel less alone in the world? What are your favorite foods? How is food important to family cultures? What happened to your father, your mother, to you? What were the causes of the French Revolution? What does “revolution” mean? Why are you angry? Can you tell me an example of an adjective, like “angry”? When will you stop fighting me? Who hurt you? Who still does? Where does it hurt? Where? Why wouldn’t you be angry? How can I possibly make this better? What do you need to be able to trust me? What do you need to survive? Are you hungry? What state do we live in?         If a milky bath softens my skin. If I’m desperate to feel a hand on my bare  body. If I turn tangled hair, tendrils of repeated hymns, dispersing: be still & breathe,  quietly. If frothy seafoam & freshwater pearls & sharp knives: dulling. If the girl held  her breath under water for as long as she could. If there are some places from which  we can never return. If humming & pulse quickening & chest rising. If someone took her. If  there are some places she’ll never talk about. If there’s no reason to worry. If the porch light  stays on all night. If there’s too much fabric, the dress dragging, collecting bone  fragments, the before & after. If this happens all the time. If there’s no reason  to be afraid. If we probably should be anyway. If cracked porcelain, no—black spot  on lungs, spreading. If harder & harder to breathe. If fingerprints on throat. If anyone can turn water  holy. If that’s what I told my reflection in the fogged mirror: we swim deeper & deeper & deeper. Once I heard a story of a woman  who carried snails under her breasts,  smuggling them to the Pure Land,  as if there were such a place,  as if any place were not.  It was not the year  of the Great Flu—1918—an epidemic  my mother had been was curious about,  before she died, not quite a century late,  her lungs also drowned.    I am drinking gin alone by a window  splashed with mud. Its transmuted berries  in my throat, belly, bloodstream  spread like the strings of the super-cluster—  Laniakea, Hawaiian for ‘immense heaven.’  Some galaxies, the scientists say, flow  toward the mystery ‘super attractor,’  while in another space, a juniper bush  is giving itself up to become a part of me now.    I have heard that snails heave their hushed bodies  up the Buddha, becoming a cap of protection,  for they know they can do so little alone.    I’m glad my mother is not alive  to hear a man insist on a wall around America.  One great war was ending when that flu ignited,  killing more then the war had. It was a year  of peace & death no one expected.  Another great war already fermenting.    Through the splattered window, I see  only the silhouettes of birds: blue jays,  swallows. That half the people want  a wall saddens me. Our immense heaven,    the scientists say, sidles up against another:  two minds or foreheads resting  touching, yet impenetrable, so much  bone and blood keeping us apart. Returning to the lake I’d thrown my wedding ring into,  someone whispered, It’s still there you know, undissolved. In the shrubs chipmunks scurried, and the man with the bottle  of Jim Beam sunned himself in the dirt path. He said he hears  voices in the winds, coming from all directions. I know this  because I hear them, as well. His mouth was an O as he raised  the bottle to; the bottle mouth was an O, he poured himself into.  My hands were ears I used to locate myself through a tunnel.  This Beautiful Thing Is Making Me So Depressed as if endings didn’t    have their beginnings  in mind, some well-meaning someone says to take it    one day  at a time, so I take it like some heroin-mirror—neatly prescribed.    it’s spring, which the sun knows,  which the birds know  because they’re all lungs, but there’s still this whole    rhetorical question of snow, asked by everything—    THE PINES, for instance:   How fucking fresh are we?    My boot tread’s ice-packed, but the buds still flash  as if from under a trench-    coat. Goddammit,  nothing’s enough yet  everything isn’t. my stretch marks run like the liquid mother  of pearl of god’s  tears I’m aggrandizing because I’m still trying  to cope with how often    I scarfed a whole styrofoam boat of nachos smothered  in sure-sweet ground  beef and gluey cheese in my high school  cafeteria before finding    my solace in a bathroom stall graffitied  (no shit) with i  ♥ jesus  my lord and savior and then I bit  down on two fingers    before shoving them all the way in  my throat like a quiver  of arrows I used to pretend I could swallow  fire and that’s what    I did every time I let my boyfriend  call me muffin  top or worse dumb I began to give up  parts of myself    to his names like barren stretches  of highways  to dead cops and lt. colonels why do we  capitalize    I and not mine why do we  capitalize I  and not you a friend’s ex-lover  paid cash    money to have some lesser star unofficially  named after  her but how many stars out there are called   Tracy the fifth    most popular name for girl babies  in 1970 sometimes  I’m re-astonished to realize I wasn’t alive  for every year    in history unborn until “Alone”  by Heart  held down the no. 1 slot on the American  charts sometimes    I come to a new place and feel I’ve been  there before  the way I feel when a date I write after  my signature    is the birthday of someone I once knew  but don’t  know anymore when I said a new place  I meant    a new stance of my body the way  my muscle and fat and  insecurities sit on my bones that day I’m told my backbone’s  gradually bending    into the letter S I wonder what makes  someone cast  an old lover’s name into the distance  of space if it’s    a gesture of the unrequited or else  a lightyear’s worth  of fuck-yous my body doesn’t stand  for anything    it’s a rigorous honesty I sometimes wish it told me  white lies my  body it doesn’t stand for anything I want it to  not    forgiveness or acceptance not the same  thing not even  the name I was given at birth the name  I come to        today while driving I was listening to “Little Red Corvette” when a red Corvette pulled out  in front of me & the traffic slowed so that the tail lights lit up my face so close were we  and I became so embarrassed I turned down my stereo so the Corvette’s driver couldn’t hear  she had a pocketful of horses / Trojans and some of them used afraid as I was he would think I was  trolling him and who wants to piss off anyone in a Corvette especially in a ten-  year-old Civic with a scuff down the side made by my grandmother’s bumper in the narrow  drive I won’t even wear a t-shirt into the store where I bought it even if it was years  ago because I don’t want them to think I’m a shoplifter I once took a rubber  spider from the Food Lion its black legs gelatinous its fangs painted red it was before  I could shelve my memories with how old I was I must’ve been three four for  nights I laid awake listening for sirens sure my cop father would have turned  me in when I was a girl I was a boy most days I made a beard from cotton  balls hot-glued to felt and slung around my ears by elastic string I played the father  in all games of house the doctor who cut the baby out of her stomach and I bang-banged  as the Sherriff (my mother misspelled it on the badge) I only became embarrassed when someone said  you can’t do that and I thought yes maybe I couldn’t only then so I became quiet as an unfired  weapon made with a finger and thumb the best thing my love ever said to me was in  a drive-thru Em you look so beautiful in red tail light I thought for an instant about driving up beside  that Corvette maxing out the volume on my ironies my pitch all my off-key fucks I shouldn’t give. It’s that sharp divide, entering in the bright  lap of day, exiting in the dark, stars    jagged, the wind with its cold surprises.  It reminds me of something I want to forget.    The night my father pulled me close, his arm  around my shoulder – a rarity – maybe    a first. Ninth grade and I couldn’t wait  for school the next day. I planned to wear    the pink jumper I’d made in home ec.  I saw the warning on my mother’s face    as she watched me soak him in.  I wanted her to be wrong, wanted to believe    that his sudden embrace was as true  as those wild flowers that bloomed overnight    in the field across the street.  Now a lopsided smile at my upturned face,    a wink, a squeeze, “Tell me, sweetheart,”  he said, ”where’d your mother hide my bottle?” The floors were fine. Gorgeous,  in fact. Blonde as sunshine, clean,  polished, alive with the kind of promise  we had dreamed. But oh those two  mismatched wooden tables. Same height  so we kept trying to line them up  as if they were a unit. One was maple,  right out of somebody’s 1950s Nebraska kitchen,  with a scalloped leaf that folded down,  though it was years before we could see it  for what it was. The other, streamlined,  sleek. Once we tried pushing them together  and covering with a patterned cloth,  though dinner guests banged their knees  on that leaf. When I look back,  I’m amazed we didn’t toss that piece, haul it  to the curb. But, no, we struggled  for years to make it work, painting  and painting it again, even turning it sideways. As a kid, I wondered if God took his coffee black  and at least four times a day.  My father did. And I    wonder, what’s the God-equivalent to catching  your father using the ring of a mug to tattoo landscape    designs on your mother’s table cloth? I wondered if God  had a front yard. I wondered if anyone has ever dropped    eaves on God, the way I did and overheard my father tell  my mother they were going to lose the house at the end    of the month. Does God know who Bret “Hitman” Hart is?  Because that’s the closest thing I knew of a superhero, and    at night, I’d throw on my dollar store sunglasses wrapped in  tin foil, the closest thing I had to mirrored shades, and wrung    the necks of my pillows. I wondered if God would chant  with the crowd as they called for the sharpshooter. When    I left nasty boy confounded on the floor, I wondered  if God had retirement and could borrow against it    to keep the house and landscape plans in full swing. I  understood superheroes to have the ability to identify    the weak spots on monsters, and what substance would  cripple evil. My father said snapdragons depend on    honeybees to make their red and yellow tongues grow.  This felt like knowledge worth remembering.  …and His kingdom will have no end. from Luke 1:33    At the diner, that’s been victimized twice by kitchen fire,  the boy sits at one of the sea-green booths across from his father  who, between a second and third cup of coffee, has said  My doctor gives me a year to live and we will trust in God.    Of hope, the boy’s father always spoke of a path, its difficulty in keeping,  the reward at the end—God’s warm laugh and a hug.    Thistle cuts the boy’s legs on the path leading  to a forest kept behind his eyes, where God is tied to a tree, his skin  bruised and broken by the teeth of other boys who went out in his name.    When the moon smudges its big finger across God’s cheek, the boy sees  the mythic creature’s eyes grown fiery and asks after all the days I’ve returned  to this place, and have not seen something different, is this the day I will see you be terrible?    How did the boy arrive at this unnamable place? It’s been easier to assess  how difficult to leave. And so, the boy prays:    Heavenly Father,  I am becoming fatherless. And I’ve developed new hunger, Lord. I’ve learned  to wash your feet in the years that a ravenous tooth can be more salvation  than light. I will become lost and look to feed on your hands as I’ve been taught.  And yet, you will call me lamb, not boy with fangs, not boy with wolf posture,  but lamb—boy living among the real wolves. Those words for the ransomed  heart. And Lord, while your red words aim to make strong a foundation,  I’ve found the roots of another kingdom, where I will go hungry,  and will always search for a meal in your sleeping bones. O boy , you’d say  o boy, I couldn’t fill you up . Here, boy, is my rib cage to be locked up in.    And in that way, God kept the boy from his questions. But boy learned  the broken language needed to say, you saw this coming, Lord. Why aren’t we more terrified of sleep,  of consciousness extinguished and no  guarantee of return? – Dean Young    You’d think that after all these years of dropping dead every night and every morning rolling back the stone, of rising from my vampire’s crypt, a forest of tooth picks sprouting from my chest, I’d have some faith, some trust that just like the sun coming up in the east I’d lift from my cluttered bed, my rumpled, sweatsoaked sheets and pillow. Don’t I believe in physics? What about bio-chemistry? But no. After five hundred lives, the memory of so many deaths darkens everything. Every day the ceiling gets lower, clouds rumbling with comets and jets. And what do they tell you for comfort? Think about the after-life, they say. But that’s all I think about. Or Forget about it, they say, it’s a long way off. But how can I forget, when even in sleep I have to listen to that raving madman (myself!) shouting out the mystery of birth, my constant mistakes. How many dark alleys have you wandered in your dreams, how many monsters met and been devoured by? I’m telling you. If I could say goodbye to it all, become an angel, one of those who never said no to anyone but himself, one of the luminous singing host who never traveled in darkness, I’d take up my wings and sweep the closets and corners of my past with a mighty shiver and flap, blowing it all away as I rose into a glory like the sun. Long rows of cloth,  the city’s riches, whiten  in damp sunlight like claw  marks scraped on the land. Bister  hardens, blue slate glitters  on canted roofs. Wind-blown leaves  flaunt their silver petticoats.  This plain, so painfully flat –  one feels the sea’s approach.  Floating like scum on fertile water,  a thin scurf of wall and roof,  steeple or mill, and rising up,  St. Bavo’s great mass,  size of a thumbprint –  all this dwarfed by the sky –  giant clouds, vestiges  of smoke and bruise, swelling to  some cataclysmic tumble –  the fullness of which we are  only the smallest part. Loca loca loca    The word is dissonance:  Cheekbone meeting palm  The static of a mic  Turned on too soon    *    It started  //with a safety pin\\  started with gentle  //metal beneath skin\\  craving safety of thought  //in the glide, the glide, the glide\\    *    A pin only pierced the memories  without letting them bleed  Wandering eyes count the scars on my hand  but fail to see the rubies peeking through jeans    *    It is only years later that I learn  the Tarahumara of Chihuahua healed  through bleedings: Rivers of red from  a curandera’s precision    The knowledge unblocked  A dam of guilt    Loca loca loca    When all I wanted was to find  Dios en mi sangre.

I say we’ll have to bury horses soon. You say it’s more work  than for two people. You need to dig deep or  the bodies move, hooves break ground  like teeth through gums.  We hold these secrets under our tongues like spit.  We jumped fences, started fires, burned your father’s tools  the first day we met. You watched me eat the pages, swallow  my history in pieces. We practiced saying each other’s names  and locking doors behind us. Entering the same red rooms  ten years later to tell you I too hold these cloven parts. the body unto itself   or a poem for the toilet where I throw up my bloodline    yes, there is a wall   inside my stomach,  Latinos Live Longer But  built from shifted organs Less Healthy Lives:  refusing to absorb    anything that enters.  it all comes back, like                           The Average Life Expectancy of    jesus on easter. like my Selected Ages (in Years) by Race  grandfather in his bolo tie and Ethnicity: Non-Hispanic White    I can’t sleep for hours  after eating. doctors’ notes (birth, 78.8), Hispanic (birth,  81.2)  written in the lining of a vessel  unsettled, different than my own.

You are multiplying from my childhood home, but who would want to enter that overgrown field? All I’m saying is two signs on the pole might be a few too many.  Hammer that emotional effort to something else. Paint something wiser on that scrap wood. No one’s asking you to invite but a little imagination never pulled the hordes of stinging wasps closer than you’ve already done. All I needed was a picture— where my father threatened to drown us, laughing. In that picture the water looked exactly like a road.        Because the parents lost their patience they decided to lose their child  to the woods near the mountains. Between the trees  bones like chapels sanctify the earth  where the heretic animals gnash. The bugs bless a log  with their gospel of hectic movement, and here where hunger  worships the fang the child is flesh everlasting.  *  What I know of children I learn from fairytales;  they are bartered then slaughtered for health or gold.  The child, barefoot & bewildered, wanders. So the wolf & blackberry,  both wild & wherever they please, appear like signs.  *  A boy is left in the forest. He leaves the forest  unscathed. The Great Nothing happened.  Isn’t that the miracle we pray for? Once upon a train station I watched a couple embrace  with such sparkler-urgency arrival or departure  didn’t matter. Elsewhere on the platform  a little boy with a fistful of daisies, dirt still fresh on the roots,  and a woman not his mother, neither hand  reaching– this is the way  the saddest metamorphosis begins.  Ever since then I’ve wanted the dazzling sun  to be seduced by heliotropes and not always  the other way around.   ~   Often longing  forks like the tongue of a hummingbird. Often each path  offers its own dead ends. In other words every old ache  is one part pollen and one part nectar. Even now you’re  wonderfully misplaced  like my favorite bedtime story  read out loud in the morning.   ~   The kindest thing I’ve ever done was lie  about every person at that station until you fell asleep.  Only then did I tell you what happened to the boy. Six-years-old, crafting in her mind herself with Casey’s hair, Logan’s smile, and Arin’s legs ‘cause they look better in the same pair of rhinestone bedazzled JCPenney corduroys. Ten-years-old, huffing after gym class fitness test. She’s in the 34th percentile. Why isn’t she good enough? Thirteen, covering her stretch-marked breasts every morning with concealer. First time she hears the voice, Good job. Without concealer, you’re not beautiful, but stick with me—I can make you beautiful. The voice is soft, seductive, gives her hope. Fifteen, best times are on the toilet—the bad leaving her body, creating empty space inside her. As if she needs more empty space inside of her. What she needs is more empty space between her thighs. She had dreams once, and friends. They disappeared with after-school snacks, lazy Sundays, mother-daughter bonding time, Shiny hair and laughter. She once stepped on a caterpillar and cried, peeled the little life from her sole, its dull green flesh kneaded like dough. She buried it deep within the woods, buried it like her grandparents and her self worth. She visits their graves a couple times a year. She avoids team dinners, tells Sam she’ll eat at home, tells Mom she ate at Sam’s, tells herself it’s normal and necessary to run at night to the jiggle of her body, which she cannot bear call her own even as it heaves in fear. Breath shallow breath quick. A little guilty, a little sick. Am I enough she asks the voice, as her body hits the floor.  You lazy worthless fuck, it says. Get up! Do more! You fail at everything, don’t fail me too. She wants to say fuck you but what comes out is I’m sorry. The doctor says better is hair that doesn’t thin with each cold and shameful shower. She thinks better is jeans that hang in curtains off her hips, collarbones holding water in their hollows. She counts calories like sheep, strokes her ribs each night to soothe herself to sleep. Takes fifty sit-ups to justify her lunch of twelve peeled grapes. Her grinding bones protest, but the voice says keep wasting. They say this voice is called ED— for eating disorder. They say it lies, hurts her, she must fight it. But ED has shown her the way through hell and off a bridge. ED has mentored her, Conscience and reality. Her closest friend is ED. They say she must reframe disordered thoughts. She’s dying, slowly, each piece of gum for dinner. But gum for dinner defines her success. Or is it ED’s? Or does it matter? Sam says, just lettuce?  I thought you were better . ED answer Don’t worry Sam, she’s saving room for later. When her birthday cake bakes, for fifty minutes she will pace around the oven, delirious in the sweet buttery scent of the forbidden fruit. Her mom will cool and frost the cake, first slice for the birthday girl. Sorry Mom, I ate a big lunch. You go ahead. But she did not put concealer on her stretch marks today. Sixteen, no cell service at camp. She would mail her mom a letter but she can’t Google the number of calories on an envelope flap. I linger stretching as they drown the elf  who grins at torture in his Christmas suit.  Their other victims, all dolls, drench the shelf  they’ve made out of a chestnut stump where boots  sucked off by mud lie half-submerged in muck.  Barefoot, soaked, the younger sister stands to roll  baggy pajama bottoms up. She tucks  her shirt and creeps, graceless as a foal  back down beside the creek to fan her hair  inside the ice-shard swirl. My chuckle breaks  the spell—no wave or soft hello can glue  their morning whole again. Both girls glare  before their sprinting feet stamp little lakes.  The cattle fence crackles at beads of dew. The mannequin’s enormous breasts  mesmerize the girl on tippy toes  who dangles a sweat-stained  fedora from nipple to nipple.  Racks of sport coats wilt  their plaid surrender. Two octagonal  clocks compete to advertise  the same menthol cigarettes above  a row of VHS tapes leaning  like slanted headstones toward  four shrink-wrapped Old Yellers.  Spine-bent record sleeves below  beam their faded cardboard dream  for us to have a Merry Christmas.  Their trains and snow and pipe-clenched  fathers reek like the morning after  a relapse bender. When her mother  yells it’s time to go the girl  throws her arms around a plastic waist  and whispers in its navel.  There is never an easy way to break  confidence, so Jade tells me    in the softest way she knows how  that she knows    why I am always searching for cures.  She admits that she’s been there before too,    searching for a second skin  that doesn’t feel so foreign to her.    She tells me about the  river, and how all of the cattails    kept following her, kept whispering  incessantly about the mosquitoes,    about the way they said that  her eyes looked like the moon,    juxtaposed so beautifully against  her freckles, sun spots so lovely that    they looked like mosquito kisses.  I tell her that she needs to    forget the cattails, and  forget their cajoling in her ear,    because that’s exactly how  they found the bodies last year,    two girls washed up on the riverbank,  tangled in the weed stalks and    peppered with mosquito bites  all over their skin, red    stark over their tan, like  the inverse of apple bruises.    I tell her to be careful, to  learn to discern the difference    between the voices of the wind,  and to buy a citronella plant,    because when it comes to mosquitos,  there are no such things as kisses.    She knows this,  of course.    She looks at me, looks at  how the edges of my eyes    also curl into crescent moons,  and tells me that she’s worried    I’ll forget, because she  read the news reports and    those drowned girls also  believed in a separate sort of grace,    told themselves they’d never  fall victim to meaningless words;    but there hadn’t been any words  that evening when they heard    the cattails, and heard the buzzing,  and told themselves that they’d be strong.    The river had a strange way of  telling them that no matter how    much they looked like the moon,  were blessed by the sun that had planted    kisses on their cheeks, they would  never be the girls that would be able    to love / to be loved —  and they felt it in their bones    the night they last saw the stars.  If anything, Jade tells me,    it’s not that we should fear the cattails,  or the mosquitoes, or even their lies.    If anything, we should caution ourselves  against the danger of lingering thought,    and all those that planted these voices,  the cattails, and the mosquitoes,    to begin with. The summer after eighth grade I started  wearing my hair differently, up in a bun  instead of a ponytail, because that was  the year I started remembering the rules  of laboratory procedure. You didn’t, kept  wearing your long sleeves next to the  Bunsen burner, even when I said you’d  catch fire, because you were all too  excited about its false sentience. You always  were, eyes tracing the bobbing flame, and  inhaling the smoke trail after it died because  it reminded you of rain clouds in summer.  You always liked the concept of cloud cover,  and I never doubted you, or your hands  flickering, moving in shadow jumps, without  warning otherwise, even when you  took my hand in yours and thrust them both  into the pitcher of ice water during that lab  in sixth grade, when we were conducting  research on whether or not the absence of heat  stimulated mountain climbers to move faster  so that their bodies didn’t shut down or collapse.  I pictured burning in reverse, the cold eating  your skin, your fingers, until the blood in you  would boil like liquid candle fire, the same way  that running your hands under the hottest setting  of the sink turned the water cloudy with heat  that felt cold. Your hands knew more than  shadow jumps, knew how to stay cold all the time,  to stimulate the fire that kept you burning,  kept you going. I remember my hand trembling  in the absence of warmth, remember wishing for a  fire, for once in the laboratory, wishing for a spark  to creep through my veins, and bring back a  semblance of life to my fingers. Instead,  I wrote in my notes that the absence of heat  did stimulate more activity, but only noticeably more  if they were used to adapting to begin with.         At night, you forget everything:  this century  the cold  the searing of hand and wrist.    At the back, the capturing goes further  into reason and rationale.    He is not open to your plenty, your footfalls and despairs.    His mistake of what is infinite is a means to an end;  a grave display of loss.    Call it: a skewering of a winged contempt.    Dolores, what is taking flight here?    Both of our worlds are a vivid falling.    You, Dolores, who are so painfully aware,  are but a flaw.  (but who wants to be flawless?)    Your knowing tethers your world to ours.  That grave risk is a secret pride.  It suggests you are extraordinary.    He turns you on and off and on. He tells you, you are not so,  but you are; you are; you know you are.    Your knowing is but a fragment of truth.          I cannot horse the dark concerns  That move into the timeless day. Say  It is easy to learn the lovelorn ways, to learn  The freckled longing, the phantom urge for what is not yet stone.  Disobey. Disobey. I try to disobey my looking for stops. Here, I will tell you  My conclusion. Here, in the noon shade, in this migrating truth, I wish for what is pure,  For what is not a loud confusion of wrong. For the way the world spins,  A design of sweeps and steps and turns.  All the sobering voices of my despair and all of these, well, these too-felt days.  We are mere creatures: we tower, we crawl, we cower, we saw.  We saw the way it could go. We pocket the touchless, the heartless, and more,  We corridor the periods of near-survival.  We reform the weeds, seal the dark shade  Of monsters made, and marvel. We marvel at what is good. (Sometimes we need a good stare.)  We hope for love and bask in the harrowed flux of tomorrow: its vision, sound and green. In the tank, they let you touch her  slime-slick arms uncoiling  for yours, your hands going white  in the cold water. Her body  is a different kind of a metal,  a copper bracelet wrapped around  your wrist. She could pick you up  like nothing, hold you so still and close  you forget the air.  A body like hers never forgets  the violence of survival.  She could disappear  through a crack in the glass.  She could take your eyes. I didn’t mean to go extinct. It’s just  yesterday ten thousand squid dried  to paper on the beach, their big eyes  watching the sun wake red on the sea.    And a woman on the bus said a prayer  for two million dead bees — anyone  could tell she really meant it. She held  her hands so tightly together they lost    all their blood, gasped ghost white.  Sometimes a person gets taken over,  wants so much to put the dead back  in the womb that her belly bleeds open.    Whoever finds the scabs below her ribs  will find the hours she rode waves bare  to the shore — for the squid, maybe,  for a woman on the bus. For a host    too small. A skin too often turned red  from light and all its damage, the color  light leaves behind to say Sorry. Never  really meant for any of this to happen. It’s the hole that’s not a hole, the cave of the smallest childhood mysteries and milky lint like the nest of a worm who graduated to moth and fled to eat the world. Can we not evolve past it and its ex-purpose?   It’s been cut, pierced, banned, stuffed, draped, flaunted. Seeing it unexpected, on a friend, leads to liquored thoughts, flighty desires. Could we enter it and be new again, ignore the reality of its unseen terminus?   And how is it a button? Vestibule, chakra, chocolate cherry, apple cleft, shot glass, goat’s eye. End of a balloon. Yes. We are our mothers’ balloons, cut off and flown like drunkard moths to hungry openings.I need to believe her when she says black  is a goddess with black eyes,  and tightly curled black hair  catching stars as she glides atop a black stallion  across a moon-night blue sky –  she assures me that black is light.    in america,  black is contrast and contrarian:  we say black poet,                  black doctor  because we need sculptors                             to carve lines  against the edge of black to contain it    today’s lesson:  tell me, how does a poet  become a black poet? a man become a black man?  Ask Tiger –  after his mug-shot.    somewhere, always here, in america  my poetry is rendered black  does that mean it is dark?  Unrefined?  art without enslaved black bodies, the editor says, is colorless,  devoid of contrast, meaning  does trauma have a color?  come on, you know the “black experience.”  you’re                 black.  does that mean I’m threatening or that I’m starless?  O, stop being dark – where’s your edge, your fire  unarmed black woman?  Don’t you know how to be black  and disappear into a moon-night blue sky? Syrian-American as in—a room with mahogany  double doors and nothing behind them    but death and dead. We all have dead.  Syria and America, two unplanned graves    of mangled legs, mud-crusted skin.  I roll my heart in, shovel the sand.    Syrian-American as in—I am only half  of my father and waning as America takes me in    without warmth, his country also waning  into a rubble where children play.    The moment I saw my father in me,  Syrian and American equal in us,    both countries turned inside out  to swallow their own humanity.    I traverse unimaginable space—a pilgrimage  undue to higher powers—and on the other    side, I reach for my father, to find what is left  when we become a menagerie    of losses. His hand, an artifact of Palmyra  kept safe in a home where no one lives.    Syrian-American as in—here we are,  far away from all the war, an elegy    for what is left over, praying for halves  to make a home.

I knew the five pillars of Islam before I knew.  And when I knew the pillars, I knew the prayers.  And when I knew the prayers, I knew that insha’Allah means if God wills ,  that God and Allah are the same though my Christian friends said otherwise,  that when I asked for something and my dad said insha’Allah habibti it meant no.  I knew the pillars and the prayers before I knew myself.  At least one of the five may never know me—I’m no pilgrim.  And when I thought I knew myself, I never found Allah.  And when I thought I found Islam, it had no pillars.  And when I thought I found Allah, they had no gender.   Allah was shaped like bare shoulders and lavender sheets—a lily reaching upwards.   Allah was shag carpet and a crisp purple neon sign— DINER or Self-Service Liquor Mart.   Allah was an entire aesthetics of pleasure. Insha’Allah the parents will understand.  And when I found pleasure, it was the word chartreuse—  peony and petrichor—a shock of my first lover’s curls dyed pink.  And when I found pleasure with my first lover they said to Nietzsche, God is Dead  And when I found pleasure it was nature and artifice—  it was Allah but also human hands.  And when I found pleasure, I started to become myself.  I asked my dad can Allah be man-made?  I asked my dad is Islam shaped like five pillars or like the sun that shines through them?  I asked my dad does Allah love me?  And when I asked my dad, my dad cried.  And when I asked my dad, my dad prayed         and said Insha’Allah habibti insha’Allah. Rain slaps the metal ceiling of this city as if it wanted inside, as if it weren’t already inside. Over the last few sweetish bites of puto, my cousin tells me that for my next visit to the Philippines, he’ll have destinations lined up, individual pearls linked on pale thread. I chew and think about more time in Baguio, the only place where it occasionally snows. I am tired of trying to avoid phrasing things in terms of precipitation—the soothing cool, its quick and fervent lashings, how it wakes me up at night, exhaling into my ear. A single shell, some epitonium .  The dogs in the streets ignore me. The flesh of a coconut, or, unbroken, its muffled sloshing. I fear I will develop a hunchback from stooping.    *    I was buying oranges in the market, shuffling through my pesos , when my friend remarked that she had been wondering why all the vendors were speaking English to her, “and then I’m like wait ,” she said, and pointed at me. I asked the vendor the price in Tagalog, which is really all I can do, and pulled my hood up over my hair. You see. There is weather in every story. The wet breeze of it slides in through the window and smells of salt and charcoal. The wind’s let up. Roaming around the apartment, my feet are long and narrow, like my father’s. I love my father. I love my mother. So what? Looking for a clean teacup. Dabbing at a spot under the burner. Outside, a huge potted plant has fallen over.        You step back always to boiling  black froth in a tin cup  to the density of flak curtains  heavier at least than the wind    stirred up by whatever  is outside exploding,  whenever you arrive  among these stone-ground beans    labeled Colombian Supremo  Jamaican Blue Mountain  robust with floral notes and balanced  blends of pleasant acidity.    After disheveling homes  with tracks of finger-size holes  left open to let a little sunlight in,  or kneeling through blood rinsed    truck-bed surgeries  while ceramic armor plates  clamped your legs to sleep  your fingers in torn rubber gloves  in someone’s torn leg—    anything that didn’t taste  like dust was saffron or jasmine  under the tongue—even dirt  sometimes, even blood.    But now which of these  mild to moderate sharpnesses  counterfeit best that flavor  when tamped into a cannon-mouth    French press here at home  in your un-demolished kitchen?  A boy was born with a pagan name in Palacios, Texas. At the  baptism, the priest pleaded his mother to give her son a  Catholic name. This is when Jesús  dived into the river between Jacinto and Cardona. He loved  eating bread in the shape of a pig on the  front steps of St. Joseph’s Catholic church. Never forgetting  George Washington bread for his mother, who ironed on  humid autumn mornings and took him by the hand  into a school with one little, two little, three little boys with brown skin like  Jacinto’s. His Friday nights were spent in  khakis and loafers, headed downtown to see movies about black  lagoons or 50 foot women. He waited for his father to return home at  midnight, smelling of grease. He was the  number one fry cook in Alice, the Hub of South Texas.  On days of his father’s last summer on earth, Jacinto wondered if the taste of  pancakes still lingered in the corners of his mouth. His father slipped  quietly out of this world, with shoes that  read “L” on one and “R” on the other in thick sharpie.  Sometimes Jacinto visits Alice, pulling  the weeds and wildflowers out of the way of bronze plaques. He  used to write poems to honor the  veins of his mother’s life, a woman  who did not know how to sign her name, only a lonely  “X” on the page. Now Jacinto teaches the  youth about Jane Eyre and hero’s  zeniths, and words that his mother could never read. The lake was bigger than its biography: sink or swim, the end was always a mirage.  Nowadays the message in a bottle is the emptiness. No one is lost at sea.  Everyone is happy. I wondered if it could ever come to this: loving the endlessness of water,  still calling it a lake. When I first learned to dive for the open, I became disoriented—  how much freedom can one take? Or be given? Some animals give birth in water. There is the joke  that a human can spend their entire life underwater if they were born there. Indeed, our hometowns say stuff  about us: you are meant to live, you are meant to live on as a cautionary tale. Los Angeles. The angels  of which valley god? Or all the saints in California wondering who left them to the desert. It’s not like  they had a choice of residence. Some places are simply not worth the money. Some bodies, too. They last  for a few years and leave no legacy. Don’t be so sure that it’s a bad thing. Take note:  celebrities give out their signatures as if to say I was here. I was here. Like graffiti  on ruins, a message to the future. You were there. You were there with me. In the lake, in the cold water  with our eyes open. What a sight we were. You insist there must be two  moons since day-before-yesterday  we saw one to the east above the little yellow  house and today one hangs, more swollen,  over the horse pasture. You are so    sure, your memory lit by blue-gray  eyes alone, unblinkered by knowledge  of how the world revolves on an axis  and the moon is nothing but a shadow fool  culled and quartered.  You laugh    in your clover-picking way, counting green  balloons tethered to a stem.  Your breath  frees dandy lions of a roadside jungle,  snowy soul from a golden mane.    At only three-and-a-half, you have mastered  the dash and stroll of story.  I let you keep your two moons  which day after tomorrow may be three.    Perhaps no moon-views are ever  the same.  Of all my children and children’s  children, you were the first to speak.  The only one who claimed the moon and knew  there were many, maybe millions. Your faith    makes me brave, as night overtakes us,  knowing that when I am shadow  you will see me everywhere.        Transport Train 7 is in motion again,  Going who knows where, the brigands  won’t say. In prison I was a stone, now  I’m lighter, shifting sand. I press my nose  against the boxcar slats and smell onion fields  growing, read the color of the sky, searing blue.  It’s June, 1939.  We all wear the same gray  uniform. Some of us, just out of solitary,  haven’t spoken for more than two years,  now we all talk at once. Zinaida recites  her own poems. Sonya says life before Yaroslavl  was long ago and never happened anyway.  Who am I? Until today I was Cell 3, north side.  I was once a teacher, journalist, mother,  wife. I recite Eugene Onegin, hear sighs.  Who knows when you’ll need a poem?  Guards pound the door, accuse us of hiding  books. It’s not me reciting poems.  It’s not God, he was deposed with the Tsar.  It’s this boxcar holding seventy-six women  prisoners in it’s arms. It’s the rustle of women  lying down on their bunks to remember love.  It’s the wind seeping through the slats of the train.  It’s these wheels keeping time to Pushkin.    *Original music accompanying these poems were written by Steve Jones who is a composer, musician, songwriter, and teacher who lives in Kensington, MD. He has written two jazz musicals. It falls from the sky, or from the northern red oak,  that used to shade my front lawn, is bigger  than a breadbox, barely, has no arms, legs,  wings. Round, it seems to glide, its skin  thinner than tree bark, thicker than leaves,  with a mouth that takes in whatever’s near.  More curious than fearful, I watch it move,  turn it, give it a gentle push. It sucks up  dead grass, moss, lichen. As I walk away,  a younger man comes towards me, twirls me,  pulls my back to his front and holds me close.  I succumb, melt into him, we float in a  warm sea. When I awake, I know what this  mouth creature is and I will always be hungry.    *Original music accompanying these poems were written by Steve Jones who is a composer, musician, songwriter, and teacher who lives in Kensington, MD. He has written two jazz musicals. I could say betrayal    I could say there is love  and it doesn’t touch this sadness    I could say  you are rain falling   you are mist rising  and icicles forming    I am a stream   a river  moving along the bed of the earth and we are  elementally the same but formally opposites  I could say language is a gauze on the  crusted heart   I could say language is all  we have    is the house we build and tear down  build and tear down   I could say …  I could say before we used words our eyes  spoke    I will say when we got off the phone  and I walked outside   the cottontail’s ears  quivered as the light at dusk shone through them.    *Original music accompanying these poems were written by Steve Jones who is a composer, musician, songwriter, and teacher who lives in Kensington, MD.

Some boys aren’t born at all, until they meet another boy & he teaches them about atoms.  Valentino planted a seed in my hands before they were hands. He told me at the roots of us all,  we were all atoms & I smiled & said I had no roots. I got here by some spontaneous explosion,  the opposite of euthanasia. I breathed & something threw me here, without my asking. There are  so many things descendant from their opposites. Like color theory, where black swallows white. Like coal,  a cleansing, whitening abandoned teeth. Black coughs up white. Like my mother, African, birthing me,  a lucid colorless inverse. I am washed out & the tide pulls me in again. But let’s go back to the seed &  the earth’s crust, the funeral. Underground, & we hack the roots into tasteless chunks with no origin.  Valentino asks me       [where are you from]        & I say some boys aren’t born until somebody dies.  Valentino asks me        [are you one of them]        & I say some boys aren’t born at all & that’s exactly why they exist. My father is the oldest pearl in my throat.  This is the uncut, ribboning itself to me, poolside.  As he fell ill, he drew trains .  Am I that far away?  Like him, kissing down a body.  You could rent this thing out. You could make a killing.  And the woods. The woods feel like the biggest surprise.          this lock on the door to the laundry which I turn  too often, washing my son’s sweet potato stained shirts,  and wish it was more than a tiny space  between the house and garage or die a little  knowing this load is far from last, though  it is a blessing, even this narrow corridor,  where a spider makes his webs in every corner,  even the keyhole, turning his tapestry of insides  into a trap that feeds future empires of silk spinners  I reload the dryer, close the door and turn the lock over,  its mechanism, an empire of entries and exits  that allow a home to carry on    folding my son’s tiny clothes,  I think of my own tiny empire- this house,  this tiny boy who’ll know so little of the lock’s work-  its inventor’s late nights, cold dinners, raw fingers,  the carrying on, turning over of self. Because, sometimes, survival looks like a sunporch crowded with living plants despite  how much I’ve been told I can’t keep anything alive. Every muscling green kniving  from the dirt, reminding me of my mama’s cutting tongue, blade up, a warning with roots.  I’m learning to care for other living things and myself. I overwater my aloe  and my liver. Forget my fern needs shade as much as my heart needs to sleep  in the dark. Crowd my tomato plants the way I choke on thoughts  of leaving myself. I kill them sometimes. I try again next season.  I touch their new leaves when I can’t sleep. Whisper my worry because  What will be left for my children? Who will take cuttings and grow them in their own rooms  if this world is dead? I give them what I have—my voice, water, house in the winter. I fill my sunporch  with the living and the dead and talk to both. I put soil on my tongue because I want to taste both.  I remember how my mama said I need a minute when she got home from work, and gave her tired  to a chair, closed the door to the kitchen to escape her screaming house, and talked  to her philodendron crawling up the wall. Like my mama packed a room with plants  like gauze in a wound, I’m trying to know healing from the inside out. After Sylvester bit me      and clawed you  you brought him back to the alcoholic  foster returned him like a defective blender  and I cried while you let out the breath  you’d been holding for those six days of maybes    the next day I bought pots of Sweet William  I dug the plants into the boxes that hang  off our deck and patted little bowls  into the dirt around the stems  I wanted them to talk to me but gardeners  recommend deheading  to encourage further flowering    Floriology is a means of cryptological communication  through the language of flowers  something I don’t know how to make out  but ever since I learned that lilies mean  death I haven’t liked the smell of them    many Victorians carried floral dictionaries  because gifts of flower arrangements were used  to send messages which could not be spoken aloud  the mimosa flower for example represents chastity  I doubt many of those were sent around    the meaning of Sweet William is contested  the Victorian dictionary lists its definition  as gallantry while others say it represents the phrase  please don’t give my cat away. I do not have a poem tonight,  but here is a rock    fish seasoned with lemon  pepper and dill, sweet  potatoes and a glass of wine.    I live in a sturdy house  on a quiet street  except during the summer    when the firecrackers  announce it’s time to refuse  sleep the way    a fish refuses the hook’s pull  toward daylight.    My father sits down with us tonight,  elbows on the table and famished.  His body was cremated    last week, his ashes left alone  in his own sturdy house until I arrive  to scatter them at sea.    How much of a meal do we save  for the dead? How do you say to them,  it’s okay to sleep now ?    or —refuse sleep, eat what you want?    or— there is no meal, just these  words, all for you? Where have I gone from:  Room of rot.  Dim, waterlogged celluloid.  Salted brine-dark room,  somewhere close to sea.  Unwindowed room.  Room far by crow-call from  my land-locked father.    How to say I want to return  from where I never knew  I was—     Girl sewn  to the window’s seam;        Girl hemmed  to the keyhole’s hollow: Is this  coming through in the transmission?  My end is static: slush  and snow from the telephone  line creeping like thistle in the yard.  Slush and static, the image  warping in the dark  nest of my thorny sleep.    Somewhere in the deep of me  I’ve buried the lock to the cellar,  the soot-singed engine-room  of memory’s looming furnace.        Somewhere  behind the thrumming lick of the mirror’s blank surface  the girl playing dead  has pinched her lips white,  has swallowed a key. This morning, light fell onto my page  same as it did in the room I was once  pinned to.        Identical, the slant and slice  of gold, the smell of spring’s breath,  musk of a foreign body’s lope and lurk.  I am pinioned beneath the weight of him  still—I think it will be a thousand  more sleeplessnesses before I can creep  my way out from under his heft, the hands  clasping the red of my lips, sealing the damp  tinge of my tongue.          Pelvis bored  to mine I am always straddled supine,  wrestled over until, like falling, I am weightless,  a reed-boned bird; a blind and diving bird.  Most days I can make the bed  a raft, him a trailing sinker around my neck.  It’s the opening eye that is the problem—  the unfurling of the moment that seizes me  by the throat and shakes.        This morning  the poem on the page was a love poem to my  skin. No—an ode to how I bit and clawed, or  an elegy to my guilty body, breaking in waves,  a new crack for every year; a eulogy. these breasts of mine still big but softer now more pendulous I am grateful to you as I never was before you were for so long a source of self-consciousness a magnet for catcalls and unwanted glances the bane of button-down blouses and golf swings how I wished to make myself smaller my shoulders slouching ineffectually to hide you I didn’t understand then the super power of feeding a baby with my body with you not an easy gift the first months so painful you couldn’t bear the touch of clothes so I lived in a bathrobe pulled open above the waist for weeks not caring I flashed my family over and over again all that mattered was latching the baby through the pain the little noises of contentment he would make his milk drunk body limp in my tired arms you rose to the challenge survived the days it took me to learn how to hold him to you nipples changing shape from the hours of friction from tongue and gums and eventually teeth the slow healing from rawness to scabs to whole skin again through it all you made milk more than he could drink I felt like a cornucopia all abundance life-giving mother goddess even now months after weaning you yield up hidden sweetness with a single squeeze so I thank you my breasts dear ones hard-working magical never again will I bow my shoulders to hide your fullness. sleep of the apples under the trees that bore them sweet smell of decay  I still dream of them the luminous ones  the few short weeks I carried each, one for seven, the other for six  once I wondered how deadness can ripen  like a fruit but then I understood and then how I wished I didn’t  I am ripening again, I am not  a pomegranate, the fruit that some say grew on the tree of knowledge  Persephone’s fall might she have known what  she was doing when she ate those six or seven seeds, their sweet redness  bound up tightly in bitter white membranes  I am ripening but I do not know for how long I do not know if  it’s winter inside me or if it’s spring. Imagine a Caravaggio. This is the style: black subtropic night  with a mouth of grey opening to a white scream in the center. Red.  The ochre tongue of a headlight. Three bodies skewed and all sinews,  contorted. The muscling of religious-based guilt. The glutton grounded,  facedown in the dust road of an outskirt, a place with the appearance of  not having ‘regular’ time. Not red but wine in his gashes.  A white T-shirt up around his shoulders. Pixelated depths in his lighted flesh.  One hand on the body, a woman half smiles for the camera,  for the morning newspaper, and the jump-suited vendors who will peddle  this rendering of tragedy to rush-hour drivers:  stalled, guilted, famished. This woman. She is the focal point, the left of center  star that understands us, here in our cars, and grieves in way that skirts death.  This woman loved this man. She did not love this man. It’s all there in  dark and light. Then, in light and dark. An overhead brightness hauls her bare shoulders  into blindwhite, casts her form against the wall of the night. Throws her.  The third figure, gaunt, is collapsed over the body. Why love, we ask. Thinness stark  in a tight tank top. A gaudy, knockoff belt drags at his core. The belt is some kind of  symbolism: doused celebration, the failed talisman of consumerism, sobered  playfulness of brothers. The uncanny-ism of violent ballads: money, whichever vice,  Gucci, Gucci, Prada, Prada, and death. Boy, keep your head down.  Keep the stalkers of the morning news out of your eyes.    Here at the interminate red light we count the ways  we’ve not died.  We remember the one who loves us and doesn’t love us all the same.  We recall the law of the land. A fresco. The chiaroscuro of our childhood church.  Guilty, guilty, pleasure, pleasure and the light changes. When I altared my wife, I was youth.  We burned into two arcs of light,    then cooled back into man and woman.  Sleep was a return—already my dreams had    lived many years longer than my body.  How to account for what transpired    in the black cities of my oldest age?  When I was youth, I thought fact was    the basis of reality. But now I know  I am earth turning on an axis of mythology.    I read transcripts of my dreams each morning  in the lines beneath my eyes, my fingers    sounding out the consonants and vowels  written in a braille of pocks and pores,    trying to discern what my body knows  about the future but hasn’t yet told me.    It hums the oms of dark matter,  the un-logic of image and word becoming    a pulse in my thigh. Let me lie down again  with the wife of my youth and exalt the dark    with our burning, before I close my eyes  and slip into the night of my longest life. Beneath the surface of any river  is a gentleness near the bottom.  That’s what she has in her,  and when I drink it down,  it hangs like a lump of amethyst  in my throat, rolls down my cheeks  like streams of emeralds and rubies.  She stands deep in the currents,  hands me her words—stones  worn smooth from consideration.  This must be another world—  such colors! I am going to build  a house for us here. But each time  I set down a rock on the pile,  it becomes another plum turned  ripe in the warmth of autumn.  She tells me to eat, then washes  the rivulets from my chin. I am  still thirsty for tenderness, I tell her,  and she reaches down again, looks  into my face, hands me another stone. I watch the lions prance  in their enclosure, a rolling patch  of grass and rock  meant to imitate the savannah.    They sense the crowd: a sign  of feeding time. A zookeeper arrives    and opens the door  to the cage. With a blunt stick  and a few gestures, he gets the lioness  to lift her paws,    roll over, each time rewarding her  with a chunk of meat.    Here we minimize their contact  with humans so they’ll remain wild. But  we also have to coax  certain behaviors from them.    But I don’t see wild creatures, only  animals trained to perform  tricks for our cameras.        Desire makes us face ourselves. The selves  we keep at bay want to break out of our bodies.    I wonder if the saying that women cannot read maps is meant  to keep us from venturing out on our own.    Maps are guides to our dreams,  where we want to go and who we want to be.    I heard a crack that sounded  like a thunderbolt, but it was not the sky.    Dust blows in the wind to faraway places, washed  out to sea and rolled back to shore.    Maps hold the stories of our lives, a record  of journeys into the unknown.    I leave it for the waves to reclaim, the sand to fill,  the hole I make in my wake.         my grandma feeds the cats in the park even though they don’t know who she is / she’s blind so it’s not like she knows who they are / either / you think she just goes up to them & is like / agesexlocation / i want to be the swampghost passing through her / or canned fish / & greasy palms / in the supermarket everything i touch / is for the first time / i buy a dragonfruit & grope it in the dark / when i swallow it clenches & unclenches / like a beating heart / in other words dying / lasts forever but feels like no time at all / in other words my grandma / speaks to voices in the television until her eyes sting / from the light / shoutout to my grandma squinting at things / like a white cat running through the trees / my suicide pact & belly of thorns / the taxi driver lugging / her sack of flesh / moon cavity sagging down her neck / shoutout to the ennui that comes after i spit / out the blackened seeds / from my latex mouth shoutout to / my cousin who thinks i should stop / eating flower petals & talking so loud / my mother says / ‘letting 奶奶 raise you is regret i take / to the grave’ / inside her grave there is / a disinfected suburbia / the monotony of the sun / a porcelain toilet so i no longer piss / squatting in fields of orchids / & dust mote bones  Here, my marriage opened  Like a pomegranate, my eyes    On each blood-slick jewel and not  On the empty spaces. Not on 90 years    Of wear on the woodwork.  Not on a porch slanting,    Bent deeply into its longing  For earth.    Here, my husband arched above my body,  Arms like the doorway    To a European church  That’s been filled with art    And bones, emptied  Of shame. Candles to give prayers    A flame. My body rose like a thin scar.  Here, our baby slept    On her wedge of rolled towel.  Her lips and chin moved through the night    Remembering comfort.  Here, our dog circled himself    Before lying down.  Outside, branches stretched above the roof,    Shuddering and helicoptering,  Leaves shadowing our house into    The eight dark rooms of two hearts. A humid winter, rain on rain. From the dark  house Zeppelin I repeats on blown speakers,  ice blending too fast with the whiskey  in whorls like heat haze, dad’s heavy  spool-top table rocking on new legs.    The plank-ends of this sodden porch  begin to curl, pulling out their nails.  I’ll swap in new boards next summer,  as every atom in me will change.    I ebb into this small town, a narrow  cracking patch of lawn, the rotten  shed following the rain down  like Plant’s voice follows Page,    like I followed you here.  A redbird on the buckled  fence even sings along,  wind, wings and light, this    old alchemy in the trees.  Nothing I can create  or destroy. World    and word. Same  as it ever was. red-lunged whales whisper in the salt beneath our sleep  give us    the chamber of the heart called dream  it is no longer anyone’s dream    to live here says the woman at the honey stand  her tongue threaded sweet with bees    we too walked  until we could not stop & then we walked here    gathered apples from the muddy leaves  used our last nickels for milk    we sat with her under the cows shimmering  & dying in the summer heat    would you rather be out of luck or out of time  halfway there or halfway through | we who are psalmic    who did once hold welcome  like music in our bones. I say we live in ocean | you say in sky    I say my mother’s people were whales hunted for their teeth  you say your father’s fathers were doves | landing in a line in the sugared fields    this much is true | my mother was a girl    mauled by dogs in a village near the sea | & after | in the blue heat  twisting loose the copper faucets | filling the house to the roof    your father was a boy who walked through stars    when he should have been walking home  a boy torn apart by wolves in winter | in the center of a busy street    the curse is | without lungs & without gills | where can she breathe    your father would stand so still at altars  so the angel’s wings became his wings    the curse is | the angel’s wings became his wings    all those years | I say | all those fish in my mother’s rooms    — all those furious wings  all those men into gods — I.  Here is a gravel road, Việt Nam. Here are patches of tropic grass that line the road, & within them leaves that rattle  like saltshakers. Here is your home, fences of bamboo tied together in black arches, & above them roofs of damp thatch that drip  to the sleeping bodies below. Here are doors so blood-warm you can see handprints, the air’s breath a hollowed white.  II.  Children in a swarm. Rickshaws drop like fly’s eggs, their drivers resting in a sweat-smoked ease. Outside, the churchyard  sycamores howl, & inside, you hold tight onto your sister’s hand, pray one day to be on the other side of the Pacific,  in America, your body bowed like a bowstring. Overhead, God throws stars like knives. Finches glisten in & out of moonlight.  III.  We kneel in pews together every Sunday in Houston suburbia. You count dreams like feathers plucked  from quail’s underbelly. I count fluorescent lights on the ceiling & ask myself how much darker the room would be with  one singed. We listen to a sermon on faith, & I calculate its equivalent in miles, the size of another ocean to cross.  O how I identify with you,  Non-bullion earing without a pair.    This burnished stud is  Something loose, broken—    It is manufactured for fashion,  Which, like love, has relative rules:    Do not put inside mouth  (Parts may cause choking)  Do not store at high temperatures  (Highly combustible, may cause burning)    I ask you, lonely earring: are we magnetized  In our own skin, stuck to bone, pointing north?    You are almost a part of everything:  Perpetual energy formed, wide-open, and only. It doesn’t feel holy. The days are jagged and raw, my body  a puffed sack, the nights a ripped-open skin. All sense of order    stripped off. The baby teaches me I am not what I thought. Not  patient, not loving, not an endless fount of joy. I’m a spigot. I’m a body    holding a body but we’re strangers to each other. I don’t feel  like anyone’s mother. He lifts his head, then drops it down against    my collarbone, then screams. I’d thought that motherhood would be  a good machine, a wheel and pulley whooshing out the dark    and sinful parts of me, leaving only love for baby’s doughy hands,  his lightbulb toes. I’m the bad one. I’m a sack of rot. When the baby    finally sleeps I stand against the doorway weeping. I’d thought  that when the baby came I’d be myself but better. I’m not. The forest here is made of girls  and automatic weapons. A sparrow calls  across a thicket of brushwood. The antelope gather    but not like warnings. When peacekeepers  come searching for the stolen girls,  the men hide the girls beneath the earth. Should this look    more like violence? The flatland is knotted  with groves of acacia, mesquite, wild black plum,  clots of thornbushes too dense for flight. The story  *  splinters out. Two girls leapt from the lorry  before it reached the forest. They sleep beneath stars  in the forked base of a red bushwillow. A velvet silence    wraps them. At home their brothers split seasoned logs  of trees like this, peeled the pale sapwood  to reveal the core of sky gray    heartwood good for charcoal and fires. The girls wake  and find a shepherd to carry the hurt girl home  across the handlebars of his bicycle. Inside the forest  *  the girls are told to choose: be made a bride,  or be a slave. A husband wraps his wife  in cloth and soon they have a son. When she’s rescued    the women at home hate her. They call her war bride,  and worse. No one touches her tiny son’s feet.  She stays covered and at night, in the heat,    a snake comes into the compound  and the boy is killed before he’s even reached a year.  The collared dove has a pale belly, pinkish-white.    The feathers it uses in flight are nearly black.  It’s the wild ancestor of the domestic dove  who’s held in cages elsewhere. The girls    are girls, their bodies porous  and woundable. The animals  can’t help them.         In my year of always autumn, I stole back the river.  Hoarded its rasp and rush as I fled    through the low, hush light of trees,  where the dawn hung on birch branches.    Light stripping the trees to bandaged bark  while I ran, my heart crushing questions    instead of a pulse—how much farther—  was I strong enough to reach the water    without stopping? Calling pain praise  may not be exactly true, but I once knelt for hours    at the base of a splintered cross  until my knees were scraped raw,    legs snagged in cramps while the visiting pastor  snaked his fingers through my hair    as if he could shake Satan loose.  When I staggered to my knees at the river’s edge,    ribs constricted to cords, was my sweat  really so different from his ragged prayers?    We both wanted to drive out something sinful.  Here, at least, I slapped water across my arms    until I could almost believe  it was a balm, and I was already healed. Here’s the truth: the least I ever weighed was 161.8 pounds,  and as I much as I wish I didn’t remember that,  I also wish, even now, I could be that thin again.    In the morning I see my sagging belly—soft putty  like biscuit dough—and remember how I could stand  inside those numbers blinking on the scale,    feel myself vanishing, and love it. I don’t mean  I wanted to die. I do mean I wanted to change.  I do mean I deserved to suffer. Or thought I did. Or do.    Then, I didn’t think anything was wrong. I was losing  only what I wanted, becoming something better.  If I tell you I think I’m as happy as I am now    because of those months, bad as they were,  that even though I know I should, I don’t regret  the skipped meals or the runs timed for the day’s hottest hour    to sweat the most, am I healthy? Healed? Normal?  This is the part I wasn’t prepared for, that it would not stop.  That four years later, I would feel just as I did then.    When the flooded river sifts its scrum to my doorstep,  and the night freight yanks me awake with its bone-clack,  will it ever end? Tell me—am I still that broken boy? Sometimes when injecting testosterone into my body  I recollect my grandmother face  The gardenia blossoms of her cheekbones waft through my memories  Rue dripping from her voice as she tells me that my breasts are beautiful  That my hourglass frame was forged by gods and who am I to shatter it  Who am I to stand in a shrine and feel revulsion  Feel that there are no gods left for me in my own body  Sometimes when injecting testosterone  I feel guilty  For having been given something by god and having it not be enough  Sometimes I wonder how I have the audacity to build my own altar  To face deity within myself and know  that he deserves more than just afterlife in his own body  I deserve more than just an afterlife in my own body  And I will build it  One injection at a time  Wash your hands  Disinfect bottle and point of entry  Unpack syringe and injection needle  Draw testosterone to third notch on syringe  (Secret:  Draw only to second notch. Remove needle from bottle.  Pull  plunger down to the third notch, to get extra testosterone)  Switch out the drawing needle for injection needle  (Twist, don’t pull)  Grab the disinfected part of your stomach  (Always choose the squishiest part)  Inject the testosterone  (the magic, the healing, the beginning)  Hold tissue over the injection site  (Close your eyes, wonder if this counts as prayer)  Dispose of syringe and needle  (Thank them). The youth group leader did not fully  listen to the song “West End Girls”    His name was Matt and he wore khakis    When you’re married you can do whatever  you want he told them at Hardees    Smiled like a sparkling fox  She ate a biscuit    Later they ate long pretzel sticks  in the choir room and were prayed over    Dear Heavenly Father Jesus our Lord  and Savior I just    Bless these teens today Christ  I want you to lift    Open them Jesus God I ask that you do this    At the lock-in in an all-gold sweat suit  dear Heavenly Father    Bless this pizza to your use  Gratitude was hard    Thank you for this little hut in my chest    Forgiveness was easy  She had done so many things wrong    Please make sure the candle stays lit  Don’t leave me here    The lights off and the sound of crying  Thank you for holding me in this light    Then a hallway opened inside her blood. She died many times. She died  in her head. Her soul died. The long    waves of her spirit died. Her heart  was a statue in room no one entered.    One night she went with her friends  to see the loud rock band whose    members dressed like zombies.  A man, the guitarist, wore a tattered    business suit. One gray foot dragged  the floor of the stage; his shoe, pointless,    lay turned on its side. She stood and watched  until pain rose up, a horror-movie    demon. The demon took her into  his lap while the music blazed into her eye    sockets, and he dug his nails into  the different parts of her body.    A latch clicked and she fell below  the earth, unlit by sons of men.    God gives riches, bread, green things, light.  But there is no ointment for this falling. The body brought out like empty wood,  silent as a dark whale in dark water.    The body a citadel in trees: getting there was  land-swimming, pushing aside loneliness,    a white man in rubber boots and all  his little dogs, the sun flashing in and out    like god’s face upon the water before  the invention of cardboard and radio    transmissions. And then the second before  she knew she was going to give it all up—    everything, all of it, until she was walking  down the road in the dark with lungs full    of the scattered, old-fashioned promises  of beginning again—the house    of her body would light up, the feet  marching as they had been instructed to do. A term for when a telescope is first used      You peer at your brother from the wrong end,  a kind of consciousness that makes him appear  less of a sibling, the friend he wants to be.    Dark surrounds that light, a swallowing.  You have to look into that light, hardly worth  the effort, it fuzzies. You swing the telescope    and there he is again, crying for milk. Pick up,  pick up. He’s a room away, then the focus  is smeared, a tragedy-in-the-making, adult want    turned to scorn, something left off,  the repair’s ragged dark and not forgotten.  Here’s a cap for the instrument, here’s    the math that goes with the lens when it’s ground  to determines the size of that cap. Capsizing is rare  in the birth order of one to the other,    but the brain has its wonts. You are alone  in the universe, except for all those other stars.  Don’t be afraid–open your eyes—he’s where it hurts.        let me tell you what I know  the morning was windy & sunny & cold    the grapefruit La Croix was losing bubbles  on the bedside table    I would be    best case  an hour late for work    when I was     in the middle of it  called     quite tenderly    by another’s name       one imagines  a thousand fishhooks    dragging through the sheets  or that our pillows     our mouths    might suddenly fill  with chips of glass    oh but honey      I know I’m no one  I stopped to wave    as he went past.

Worry ruined the only black stilettos I own.  Worry  knows    I hate my legs. How I’m flatfooted and ordinary. Thinks I look    better in boots. Worry claws at the red freshly painted door, tore up    the Crate and Barrel.   Worry doesn’t care: about cortisol about twelvehour desklunches, about the boss    that hired me to argue. Worry barks until its fed. Worry worries I don’t give enough. That even sleep is lazy.  That I will be fat never full. Worry hungers. Begs  for half my  meal. Drools at the smell of blood: steak, bacon, thighs.   Worry whimpers. Needs to be walked.   Wants the neighborhood to see. Worry pisses on every flower. Knows some name it  allergy. I told Worry I bought  a cage.      Worry barked so loud    the neighbors heard. Worry   hasn’t had its shots. Worry: never neutered.  Wants to breed. Wants to get on everything. Always says look how fast     I family.    Look how many rooms I live in now. the best way to test whether a mirror is one way glass  is to press your finger to its surface & see if the images connect    revision : the best way to test whether a mirror is one way glass  is to press your mouth to the glass & see if you taste the trapped  on the way your lips kiss back    at night animal eyes are all mirror / all glint / forest become still life  of blink & hunger / become wall of reflections / stars staining tinted glass    near-death is a word bloated with relativity / beached jellyfish splayed open  over dark sand / body fat with light / beauty reduced to mechanism for survival     revision : the night’s eye is bloated with light / splayed over body    interrogate comes from the Latin roots inter [between] + rogare [to speak]  this captures none of the violence of this word    early philosophers believed that all light came from within / human eyes  that vision was simply the reflection / of fire that began within us    reflection comes from the Latin root reflectere [to bend back] / perhaps this word  knew in birth the violence of its name     revision : the reflection speaks / in bending back the light / our mouths  bloated with guilt / this too a reflection / perhaps the dark of the eye  is a confessional    perhaps near-death is a different word in the mouth of the hunter / perhaps guilt  is the same / silence is every species’ first language / a mechanism for survival When the phone rings in hushed stillness of pre-dawn, before the larks stretch their songs to the blue, to the blue — it’s not good news.  You didn’t wake this last week — eyes closed to fluorescent brightness, to the pink cheer of painted daisies, window shades blocked against copper sunsets. Where were you, wrapped in sleep-yet-not-sleep?  Rain and more rain while I worked, bought milk and bread before the storm, caught a cold, cooked dinner — you channeled your strength to cross that last bridge, not looking back even as it crumbled behind you.  I    Preoccupied by the floorboards,  at a poetry reading  I saw a yellow-jacket,  or just a bee, struggling  with what I would call, in myself,  drunkenness—  Wandering a bit, but never far,  indecisive and writhing  until lifted into the air.  Dragged, by a spider  hovering over it.  Not drunkenness then. Poison.  or just plain tangling. I don’t know  how a spider kills a bee.  I had heard engineers could not  improve a hornet’s form  for efficiency, and I imagined  that nimble elegance  dragging a tether equally  strong and light.  It struggled a bit.  The poet continued:  Those with the time   for poetry don’t deserve it.  The poetry or the time—  I began to wonder in that  small moment of my life,  in that whole life of the bee.    II   After a Photograph by Emilien Urbano: The Bodies of Two Yazidis   Killed by the Islamic State, Sinjar Iraq, 2014  Did the killers, or at least  the men assigned  to dump the bodies,  consider composition?  How best for symmetry  and depth of field to heap  two corpses, carpet-wrapped,  amidst the brown field’s  furrow, its straw grass?  Did they think about the parallel  arch of tire tracks,  how they’d texture the earth  and flatten the sky?    No—not carpets,  blankets, fleece synthetics  gleaming contours of sunlight  among their wine-maroon tangles,  diluted gold, and lavender.    Blankets or carpets, regardless.  Regardless, the light—bodies  sloughed in a field then photographed.  In their repose  deserving more than this poem  and its portions  of sky framed by power lines.  Its telephone poles,  like tall crosses, receding. When I am a teenager my mother asks with tarragon in her teeth if I want the operation. The growth of myself is beyond the ideal gradient of Swiss ski slopes the concave arc of my belly when I blow all air out just to look at my ribs.  Do you think I need it I don’t ask and shovel yogurt thinking of sand or snow things that can be pushed, brushed, melted, away.  My cousins went to Tehran for the procedure, went home slick as horses. I longed for their bumps like reflections. Cheaper there, my mother said. But we’re not going back.  He makes borders on my back with magic marker, holding the blade of my shoulder the way one holds a piece of cut fruit.  The skin covers the things we carry on our backs water and fat and all that we cannot place in memory. It is different for each. Here is where I hold years 1978-1980 that we don’t discuss still don’t know where Reza was hiding, which refugee camp he landed in, the bodies, the cards he still gambled with. If I am still I can hear those years ringing. I’m sure if he cuts me open he will find all of my hair wrapped around those years like wheatgrass tied for wishing.  We will never look like horses they will always consider us camels. Still I would like to know the cost of cutting this body just to see what I am holding. The man flips my passport and he lands on my head, hijabed and unsmiling. He peers from above the pages, fanned as teeth and places me in the desert in fixed caravan tableau with blanketed back.  He asks me why I traveled to Iran a year ago, my eyelashes grow longer.  I just came from Paris, I say. I blink slowly so my lashes sway. But that trip I went back with my mother. He looks down my shirt, the bareness of my growing neck, my breasts, talismans to deter the evil eye, Allah medallion, the hook of my bra.  He asks me if my mother still lives in Iran, and I want to ask him which one, which post-revolution Iran are we speaking of here. Thirty-year exile, you live in two places at once. My feet calcify into cleaved things on the carpet, toes growing together into just two on each of my feet.  Atlanta, I say. She lives here.  He asks me what she does and I grow a pair of legs to support me, for I have been standing too long. He flips through passport pages, the book of stamps from other countries. Singapore, huh? he says. The growth is swift, for all he knows my extra pair of legs have been there the whole time. I lose my black hair. I lose the smile from my mouth. I lose my fingers and arms and the angle in my nose. I lose the my purse, my travel pillow. I say she’s a math teacher. She teaches high school. She’s a citizen.  He asks me why I went to Turkey. He is looking beyond me now, at the humps emerging on my back like two breasts with no milk to give, no nipple to suck, gratuitous and grotesque in their nudity. The more he stares, the bigger they grow. I am not the dromedary camel of his dreams. He does not hear me when I say it was a long layover to get to Tehran . My mother has never seen Istanbul, sightseeing.  He asks me if I went to Syria, his eyes still on my back fat. I try to say no but I spit instead and it sticks to the blue of his uniform. He stares at my Iranian visa, the craft of the paste holding it together, Just due diligence , ma’am. He cuts me free with a punch on the page, a final look at my western passport photo.  He says Welcome back, but I do not ask if he means it. Should I feel lucky? They are changing some of us into animals in waterless deserts of back rooms, and some of us are sent back to deserts they imagine we come from. He puts my carryon on my back, between humps. My transformation into the being he always saw, the domesticated camel, is not, will not be, complete until I say Thank You. I know what You do Fire-Hand Man Death God perched beneath that dart board fondling my  red     glass (pomegranate juice and gin) with that red red     grin as if  I’m something You could win  O  Great Named Unmoorer Eldest Son I watch You saltshake my concussion in that cup six-month amnesia cleft salve     I taste it in the air     bitter as Hell  O believe in Me, Thou Most Feared I know how You yearn a leashed beast kept pet two-season mirror in flesh deep-seeded full-throated full-seeded deep-throating  I know what defends the crown of My desires  so  if tonight must mean a few sips a few spars with Your pitch red   pitch fork Cock  well then  Sweet Heart  Tar pit  tur  pen  tine  be warned  I Hand-picked these dagger shoes  just for you  I pain- ted these Lips royal blue  o legendary doom  i’d dress nice this first night if I was you. This is the only way I can love anyone anymore:  in circles of scorched rubber and metal,    my back a refraction out the open window,  an English Ivy hand strangling my neckline.    This time the hand is your hand, the white  knuckle panic too, your voice carrying over    manufactured wind; Aren’t you  afraid of anything?  Of course. There are the standard things: rabid dogs,    the IRS, leaving the iron on, losing my credit card, my  keys, my mind, but there’s no one to put the fear of God    in me tonight. This is all about trust, as in: I trust  you’ll hold me tighter than any woman who’s come    before me. And we’ll call this love and laugh, choke on speed  and asphalt fumes, and after I abandon you, you’ll do    more dangerous shit—jay walk, have unprotected sex  with strangers, eat raw shellfish, Zumba—    and you’ll love it until you’re inevitably wounded. Then  you’ll curse my name. But we’re not there, not yet. I’m just    a sweet arc bathed in parking lot lights and you’ve never  been more excited. In a few minutes there will be no    tires; the polka will end. Last call then, a death wish skidding  off my tongue: Go faster baby, I just need you to go faster. She’s got diamonds on the soles of her shoes.

I could live in the supermarket for days, doing nothing but smelling the ripe pears, leafing through the lettuce, watching boys in green aprons stack loose spinach on top of a rack.  Their fragrant roots smelling of far-away farms, memory of worms, and those who worked the dirt. Tending the weeds that became the salads and seasoning of pasta and picnic where boys lift their long necks upward into the sun, their faces bright as God’s after he saw the earth was green.  I want to live in the aliveness of these cabbages peeling back their leafy masks to rain, walk the aisles chewing the seeds of the strawberries, talking into the ears of the corn. Touching the soft flesh of the peach and papaya.  I put my thumbs into the skin of strangers, the strangeness giving way, the continents exploding against my fingers, smelling the way the lemon’s soft rind holds its history of citrus.  I pick one up and thump it hard on the head. The deep round sound it makes, as though a pink monastery bell were ringing inside, over a wet village where people lift their eyes to a sky filling with music, and mysterious color and a summer light that never ends. In Washington DC, the streets were full of sparrows picking bones out of KFC buckets, children selling candy bars, homeless men who shouted   God bless you to anyone who would throw them a dime. I moved to the city the year the Tsunami hit Indonesia, Katrina hit New Orleans, people took refuge from Darfur.  On the bus a woman with no teeth asked if she could move in with me. I told her yes, then got off at the nearest stop.  Everyone wore the same black wool coat. A man named Cowboy kept running into me on sidewalks. He never asked for a handout,  but one day I traded him a dollar for some shampoo and a book he had found in the trash. It was the year I got a job raising funds for a girl  with no shoes, discovered the cheapest pizza was on Columbia St., and found a man who would hold me all night when neither one of us could sleep.  I loved that city the way the Metro sounded like an empty cathedral, the way mist obscured the National Monument, how the night  was warm as apple cider all summer long. Then in November, the leaves fell. A boy at a bus stop threw up on my shoes.  A man with barbarian teeth tried to open-mouth kiss me in the street. I returned home to find my keys locked inside. I walked back, over a bridge  and found a father and his son pull fish from the freezing water of the Potomac. It was the year the cement filled with their naked gills.  The night filled with fog. The geese waddled away, and I saw the moon appear in the river. Face of an adult woman, stepping alone into the cold.  Today blackbirds fell from the sky in Arkansas.  On the coast of South Africa, fifty-five pilot whales beached themselves in the sand.  I consider the squirrel, dead on the highway,  and the cosmos, how everything began like opening a bag of potato chips.  Scientists still don’t understand string theory, or how the whales got lost.  This morning I found a rat skeleton by the wheel of my car, another outside the door to work.  One day my cat caught a mouse, but left it, still living, on the patio.  It breathed hard and looked around at the eucalyptus trees.  The heaviness of a last breath seemed immense. I couldn’t take it from the mouse. I just watched  and waited. The pressure of the atmosphere on the lungs was too much.  Animals know what they’re doing, but I cannot turn off the motor in the heart, beach myself on a lonely coast.  I look on the internet again. More dead blackbirds, this time in Kansas.  The whales are so big that scientists have gone down to the beach to euthanize them.  Some things are so heavy we can do nothing to put them back where they belong. You can clutch at the remnants with your fingers,  you can breathe and meditate, you can rant and rave.  You can hold the hands of those closest and pray.    What will you take as the city burns, as the volcano erupts,  when your landscape is cinders and ash?  Will you have the strength to hold it all together,    when the atoms, the bees, the planets – all trying to fly apart?  In the storm of zombie apocalypse, or in the quiet of a waiting room  who are you willing to save, or lose? Are you ready yourself    to face the coming dark? We all teeter at the end, unsure of our next  steps, what awaits, a bright light or dark grave, a final blow,  the way we look at the birthday candles and say, “Make a wish.”    May dragons or angels await you.  May your memory burn like an imploding star. I was almost named April, an easier name for me to pronounce and others to spell, a month announcing beauty, falling blossoms, a welcome change. A spring breeze, easy to love, easier than me, so maybe they were right not to give me a name sure to evoke petals, not panic. Jeanne d’Arc, a different kind of girl, burned at the stake at nineteen for being too strong, too good at being in charge. A peasant who talked to God, who led armies, whose king betrayed her and whose enemies burned even her horse, fearing her power. Two kinds of women – women who are petals and those who are peasants, women who burn and women who flower. In the evening my body burns, nerve tips tingling, sending me signals of fire that aren’t there. Maybe my brain was damaged by God, a heavenly touch too dangerous, leaving charred fingerprints. A writer who can’t control her fingers, sometimes even can’t form words, is a girl captive, losing a war, odds stacked against her.  Let the nighttime winds bring in the scent of lilacs, the small pink detritus of cherry trees, let April return to soothe the roots with rain, the cold with pale sunstreaks. I will not be April long. I will follow my namesake into the flames. As we stand arms akimbo, my hair burns white in the sun.  My father is mixing sulpheric acid on the asphalt driveway to see what will melt.  The cats circle, my mother sings and cries at a window. It rains and stops.  We sit in the mud. Chunks of the driveway flake off, fall down the hill into the creek.  The house is tilting west. A doe comes to the backyard, holding one front leg at a right angle.  Sometimes, the bark of a live oak tree will turn into a sleeping cat.  The tree house is filled with wasps and echoing screams. He painted it orange and blue just for me.  Flour, powdered sugar. Water. This is how I make dinner for the family. When I was first able to walk, I fell into a doll. I named her (—) until my grandmother hit that name out of my mouth.  We wore identical cotton frocks: red with black camellias, a black ribbon tied at the neck.  Lace at every opening, stiff, ugly as bark. I fed her tinsel along with the yellow cat. With the screen door open, the animals started to come inside. I named her Christine because I couldn’t imagine another word. I stared at the pink wall next to my bed with my hands over my ears.  The wall receded. The pink became liquid. Everyone’s face wore a frown that day, and someone was put in the fireplace.  My father laughed and laughed when a women’s hair caught fire.  But that was another party. At first I wasn’t sure if I’d heard him  or the rude A/C. Water pipes  conspiring? Coiled pipes  of my own body creaking pink?    There was much to hear from the couch,  & by twelve I had learned not to trust  my senses. When I drank water  I tasted salt. When lights turned on  or off I tasted salt. When people spoke to me  intensity of salt taste defined their words.    Besides, I thought,  anything could sound like a breath.  Maybe the wind quickened me.  Maybe a fan upstairs. Maybe  a handful of maple samaras corkscrewing  down outside made me hard.    Any answer for What spoke?  that meant escaping the red word said.    — alone :: alone :: (queer) :: alone :: alone —    Again, in the dark, where I knew my bones  I heard the faintest rustling  like he’d turned over in his sheets  & a brine of bitter ocean flowers filled my throat.     I opaled in the sterile moonlight.     After,  I looked out the window: A jury  of nightjars in his mother’s white rosebush  six of them, silver-brown, preening  themselves among the glowing blossoms.     I knew what I’d heard.  I still hear it sometimes  late Spring, before dawn     —the faintest rustling  of wings.          i.     What was left was not  nothing. Blurry   outline of a boy   paper epidermis abraded  to thin raw strips.   This world lets nothing remain   colorless. Please, I’ll be anything.  Draw me. Drown me in hue.     ii.     I’m not a hummingbird I’m not in love I’m not lying I’m not sick I’m not eating I’m not lying with a boy on a cliff in a dream I’m not in love with sick I’m not eating a hummingbird I don’t love him I don’t love him I’m not here     iii.     What was left was not nothing. It was hungry.     iv.     Unlatch the self-loathing.  Open the terror.  Climb out that window  into light.   Tomorrow.     v.     Draw me. Go ahead.  Let’s see you do it   without drowning.      vi.     My mouth is full  of blank receipts.   Who is responsible?   To whom can I return  this?     vii.     Unlatched the sick. Opened  the cliff. Climbed   out the hummingbird.   Go ahead. Draw me.  I’m not here. Before I was old enough to fold up pain and carry it in my wallet, I was paid to open the vet’s office, stand in the corner and watch men cry, their ears pressed down by the loneliness of a wordless decision. While an animal pawed at slick metal, I catalogued each retreat: how owners peeled themselves from the wall to press their lips against a dusty feline head, their nods at the floor before sniffing and making an exit. I remember, years later, pedaling my bicycle through the mountains, meeting the exposed face of a gutted bluff, jagged and leaden. The morning was so quiet I could hear fog spilling across the road like slow marbles, blotting the cliff’s rough edges and carrying the wisdom of the dead. A row of trucks rested in line, engines cold as unpacked syringes, my legs aching and calicoed by shadows. The skint ridge glinted wordlessly, what we’ve taken to mean permission–– the world crawling across itself like a cat with broken back legs. I thought back to the room with a polished steel table. The matted underbelly and dried-out veins of leaves. How I would unlock my hands, twist the knob, and bend through to see the doctor pressing down a needle plunger, thumping out any air. After the first time, he asked me,  Do you want to know how to tell if it’s gone? His finger bent like a churning backhoe. He leaned in close and pressed his nail to the black center of the cat’s eye, said Look, and buried it slowly. It doesn’t blink. Through a rust-chewed hole in the carport roof, sunlight makes even an oil slick appear worthy of praise. A septic tank sleeps under the shade of the only tree in the yard like a tractor being eaten by weeds. Picking at the meat of a split pecan, you think you have found the answer to the only question a twelve-year-old in Choctaw could possibly carry:  How can I stay in this green world forever? See how tender your heart is––it snaps the belt and whips itself. Beyond his squinted eye, your brother has done the impossible: made a single pellet ricochet off a coffee can full of rusty screws and bite out a piece of your elbow. He jerks up his sleeve and presents the thickest part of his shoulder, an offering for not ratting him out, pulls an M-80 out of his pocket and holds it in his fingers like a vial of blood. There you are, swinging and swiping his most precious token. With the gun leaned against particle board, the two of you bury the bomb in the chest of a bug-chewed tomato, imagine blasting a crater big enough to sleep in. But the wound is a dusty red disappointment, oozing and raw on the plot where your grandfather paid the neighbor to put a bullet in the head of the family hog. A bald patch beside the pump shed chokes in silence, tarp-worn to the soil. Deer are strung up there in season and stripped of their skin. One night, after supper, you walked out beyond the comforting hymn of the porchlight to find the white cat with a withered back foot snakebit and seizing. Now strawberries run across the face of the earth like drops of blood. A field cannot be empty, only full  of fieldness. A factory near the tracks    next to a field can be empty. A home  is often empty. Sometimes the train    goes so quickly for so long,  it becomes difficult    to think of ever walking again,  the delicacy of that motion    to which the entire body commits itself.  And sometimes the heart turns    into an engine, surging  at the thought of being elsewhere, elated    that, so solid a muscle,  it persists, even through Trenton,    or seeing some old church in Pennsylvania,  the steeple cardboarded    against the dead-computer sky.  I’ve been in a suburb before, though    it’s so long since I was outside of something,  but not so far away as to be elsewhere. My grandmother was all I knew of Damascus. She lived for over seventy years in Amman  but remained a Damascene. Her morning coffee unsweetened, chaste. Her distaste for the messiness  of a newer country sometimes uncontained. Some years she made her own vinegar,  slender bottles of it, blushing rose, bitter and tranquil on the shelves of a modest pantry. Other years,  she made her own apricot preserves. When the tree behind the kitchen window had been generous  she simmered the fruit, sunsets she nestled in salvaged jar. The rice she made was legendary, each grain coaxed  to suppleness by salt and steam, a dish my grandfather would sprinkle with sugar and eat for dessert  were it not for her gentle chiding. My grandmother was all I knew of Damascus.  She always folded a tissue, a dove’s wing at the edge of her sleeve. Lemon blossom water  lingered beneath her ear lobes, at her wrists. She floated gardenias in coffee cups and wore her sapphire ring  to sit with us in the garden. For as long as she was my grandmother, tea was served once the last verses of afternoon  prayer were intoned, sipped like the words of the suras, amber darkening on elegant lips. Never more  than one teaspoon of sugar, stirred soundlessly with the smallest spoon. Then  The light is a molten weight, a mountain of thirst. It turns the old stones of their houses into an ocean, azure dissolving into distance.  And they are a chiaroscuro huddled on the arthritic bridge, bodies scant as bed clothes, damp and wrinkled in the throes of nightmare, bodies trudging in low relief against limestone.  Who spoke first as they walked? Did the boy in slippers shuffle ahead asking after his bicycle? Did the old man mutter end-of-days verses between sobs? The sun scores tender scalps, inscribes legends on a map of loss.   Now  The light is damask draped on the clothesline. Tea glasses touch with castanet swiftness, a mint haze floats over the women’s words. The gate groans and the clap of slender heels on cobblestone ushers in the evening.  The tea darkens in the pot as the cicadas prepare for their supplications, mosquitos ready for their night raids. One of the women slides the deck out of its box, halves it, begins to deal. Another reaches for her monogrammed lighter. Their laughter a rustle of curtains drawn.  String-of-pearl smiles enrobed in scarlet give way to cigarette kisses, the smoke undulates, threads between soft curls and crepe collars. Manicured fingers wave fans of kings and queens.   Later  The light is irrelevant, though it fills quiet rooms of departure, great cones of it, dust mites swirling wild with gold. How was the news delivered? Inscribed in the ink of dreams or churning in the dregs of coffee cups? Sick with yesterday’s fever, the newspaper yellows in the stairwell.  Bespectacled experts survey the patterns in prayer beads for signs of structural damage, of impending collapse. There is no wind to carry omens through our windows. The dust creeps in to cover our feet again, another land crumbling onto our skin.  It hasn’t rained in years and the locusts walk among us, sunlight ricocheting off their medals. Take me     to your hometown & hug your hot-dish mother  In front of your red-aproned relatives I will lick     lick  your pink      neck that tastes of blond fuzz     & SPF 70  Baby     take me to your state fair & let me feed you  fried sticks of butter	    watch you deep throat     every ball & batter  Take me to, nay, at your father’s dairy farm the good ol’ squeeze & squirt  No foreplay     you’re a natural like that grass-fed heartland lust  back rippling like tractor tires plowing a country     that does not want me  Oh sweet apologetic boy your shoveled bed     was all I was good for  & you turn this land saying     Sorry but I’d prefer if you didn’t stay over  Tell me     how many times must I come hard      like an animal  to rattle the fence     at a dream that gives no pleasure     in its shattering. The cowboy probably doesn’t think much about asking me if I’ve ever worked  with my hands to make a rope. I blink away the feet of a million dangling corpses brushing my eyelids,  and I sit down next to him. I sit because The South is 2,000 miles away. I tell myself these are different stars  and bars bumper stickers; the firm faces in the restaurant don’t carry ghosts behind them. Dakota  and Alabama: The difference between a graveyard and a Halloween party. We work,  and he tells me there’s a difference between a right and a left-hand rope,  something about bleeding thumbs we don’t want to think about  this Saturday morning while 1st graders dodge between our shadows with clay in their hands.  We joke about working on the weekend, and he tells me it’s okay  if I want to turn the crank slower. But the gear keeps slipping. Nature  knows something’s wrong, something muddying the air of this cloudless day. But we keep digging  our own graves. We build the predator drone. We pay the butcher’s salary. Some  rope made by a black hand had to hug a black neck, and the black hand working to turn hemp  into horror had to open its palm and accept payment for a day’s labor done.  The cowboy tells me to stop turning the crank after another minute or two.  We’re finished here. He hands me our creation with a smile,  says something about using the rope to string up my baggy pants. They have to be happier here. Lord knows they couldn’t survive in their homeland. Let them be pets in a kennel. Besides, I can’t own a pet because of my allergies, so I don’t have any rights to an opinion on this. I shouldn’t even mention the word captivity because this is still Alabama and, well, you get it. But I did mention it, and I did see African plunder in a Southern cage, and I did see the Confederate hospital, and I did see the tiger-tooth gleam in so many eyes when they got to shake my black hand and introduce themselves. There’s a Tarantino movie here. I discover the lion was stolen from the same village my ancestors were stolen from. He recognizes a kindred scent when I put my hand on the cage. I see my mother’s motherland in his cold stare that isn’t cold to me anymore. I discover my roots and ride my lion brother into the board of trustees meeting and we both eat good that day. There’s a Shyamalan movie here. A calm, sleepy setup building to a gasp when the twist reveals lion dads and moms ohhing and ahhing and pointing while they walk cubs up to the cages where humans nap and roll in the sun-broiled grass. There’s a Tyler Perry movie here. The lion really left Africa because he was running with the wrong crowd and one of his bad lion friends ate a guy and he didn’t know they were going to eat people. He thought they were just going to scare some kids, so when he saw the feet and ribs dangling out of his friends’ mouths he ran and stowed away on a ship to America and found work as a school mascot, but the school president is watching a show called  Most Wanted Lion Gang Member and sees never-before-seen night vision footage of the crime. And he wants to fire the lion, and calls the lion a liar, and he can’t believe he let the lion around his kids. But the lion says that we all have a past, and the lion’s friends show up. They tell the president about how the lion has grabbed the kids’ imagination and given them something to look up to. Then a baby kills the scene with a tiny baby lion roar, and the school president relents and leaves the lion in the cage, and the lion is left to count how many locks have to click before he can call himself free. But you know all this ain’t about mascots, right? It ain’t about movies, either. A black man’s job should never make him think about Spike Lee movies, so I won’t go to the next staff meeting and joke about there being no brothers on the wall in any of the office posters. Besides, there’s only one other brother in the office and a couple of sisters, and, if they missed out on the joke, this job would be lonelier than it is. I know I should be better than counting the number of black faces in every room I walk into, but I’m still a slave to the mathematical proof of one black face + one black face = infinity or zero black faces because America   doesn’t know the difference between two black faces and an armada of black faces. America only knows a black face means it’s time to fire off a question about basketball or Black Panther . If there were more brothers on the wall and more brothers and sisters in the hall, then maybe I wouldn’t leave my door closed so much. But maybe I would close it more because I don’t know how to love a black face because I never wanted to see my own face as anything more than a rental that wasn’t likely to make it past its warranty. I’m only playing a role. I’m Mookie. I’m Raheem. I’m the Mayor. I’m the heat making the world squirm and scowl and hate God for making me.         Talk to the wound like it’s a microphone  or just another pair of lips,  parched from words it had to say  (but couldn’t, for lack of ears.)  Praise it as the line crossed for the first time  between  subjectivities,  two sacs of chemicals and feathers,  two colliding stardust vessels  on an impenetrable night,  visibility reduced to a chain of rusted yellow light.  Kiss it only when completely compelled to,  which is to say empty  enough to believe it can fill you.  Suffering’s not  the only way  to have a body,  and a body’s  only meant to be a gate into the earth.  Tell the wound you’re sorry,  enter it completely,  await another birth. sitting on a man’s face with Catfished blaring on the wall-mounted television  to out-sound our sex noise, because his mother is hosting brunch downstairs,  sitting on his face after waking from fitful sleep, nine hours of leaning  into my breath to steady an erratic heartbeat, counting up to ten  and back to one because I should feel so good with my warm lover curled  around me and the hundred short drives of seeing his hometown  and eating its burritos on its beaches and laughing at the worlds’ fair architecture  and how the radiant city movement was an orchestrated intimidation  beloved by fascists as much as our kid selves loved Balboa Park and hollered  into its scientific instruments, whispered into the dish that sent my whisper  to the room’s opposite corner, and I count my breaths up to ten and back  to one while road noise filters up the valleys and through my hollow earbones  and into my hollow body that even after all this sun and sex and exercise  wont process serotonin, even full of love and burritos and beaches feels hollow, even  awake and sitting on his face while laughter filters up the stairs and while we shush  each other, up the volume until the woman on the television reveals  that she was catfishing her ex-husband all along, wanted him back and wanted it  blasted on television, good and public, and we are shushing while the flat screen  and the white elephant are laughing louder and louder and I come wondering if I’d be  proud to know my son so loved to please his women, even the un-pleasable ones        The cow’s lashes catch the rain—sudden  deluge, as if Lugh himself yanked  some stopper from the sky. Valleys  fold the storm into pockets.    At the cliffs, gale winds gave way  to decadent sun, instant to instant—  little could we predict. From the window    of the tour bus I watch a pair of ducks  waddle through tall grass. You sit  in the row in front of me, careful—  I think—to keep me    from getting the wrong idea.  The mallard flaps his wings, rattles  his neck toward a splotch of sunlight.    Ecstatic at the cliffs  we dangled our limbs  over all that emptiness.    Give me an inch of cliff face—  you know the rest. I find a dry spot  on a park bench. I buy a half-    pint. My self-help book cautions me  not to fret over what I can’t control.    At the cliffs, the wind billowed  our clothing for a moment—cold  air wicked sweat from our ribs. We inched  on our bellies to the edge, our faces  hovered over the Atlantic. Sea-birds froth  below them. All these vacation homes  scattered empty on the Irish coast. Houses full  of nobody. Still, the mournful laid-down    cow follows the bus with her gaze,  and the ice-age long ago dragged    a kind of lattice into the granite  of the Burren. After lunch, you sit behind   We’re on the wrong side of the bus   to see the geologic remnants    out the window. I crane across the rows,  will sacrifice my dignity to get the picture  every time. The littleness of a moment  makes me desperate    to hold it. After we left the cliffs  rain streaked the bus’s windows.  I turned enough to see  the light ripple across your face. it’s like she has a premonition.  After she leaves you’ll explore her off-campus apartment, snoop in her drawers, try on her graduation cap.  You will smoke her dope & drink her last Bud Light. The two of you have never been close.  You’ll read the roommate’s diary, take notes.  The cat, a tom of indeterminate age, will rub his thin, orange body against your ankles.  You’ll walk into the bathroom to pee, gag at the litter box teeming with hardened turds, avoiding the ones on the floor.  The ammonia of cat piss mixed with the unmistakable scent of soiled Kotex will leak into the hall  where it will mingle with four-day old Mexican food and pizza stuck on plates in the kitchen.  You’ll recall your stepdaughter’s slovenly ways, how badly she treated you, how relieved you were when she left home.  The cat will pace, yowling at the bathroom door like Tom Petty. But when you put him in the litter box, he’ll balk, stare up at you with marmalade eyes, nudge you toward the front door.  It will be an act of mercy.  Later, you will sit on the stained couch where you’ll watch reruns of Forensic Files in the fading light, and wait for your stepdaughter’s return.  Then you will deny everything. The first time I pray I stand next to a fish alone in a pond at an off-season beach house with an empty electronic food dispenser. Waterline so low the lotus roots wave back. The koi keeps scaring itself with its own fins, sweeping the bottom of the shrinking pond. I imagine it feels like a new angel, all gauze and yaw. And when it leaps into the air the first time, we both tread for a moment in wonderment, two Os of mouth, gasping. Better here than where we’ve been lately. The psychiatrist at home put a name to it. Called it despair. You’re inside despair, she said. The second time the koi springs from the water, a blue heron lands a stone’s throw. How long since it stole the others? When the whole siege of herons ambles up, I search for a bucket. The best I can do is the fish hammocked in my shirt. And there, having just lost a baby, and against me cradling an abandoned fish, surrounded by beautiful birds no one ever sees up close, I know this is a prayer. I call the koi Angel but try to guess what its name really is from the handwritten list on the fencepost:   Ryuu   Dragon   Sora   Sky  Hibiki   Echo    Yasu   Peace  Aki   Autumn   Haru   Spring  Kouki   Shining   Hope   Hajime   Beginning         smell like a butcher in here?  Long relationships manage rare moments of surprise, sometimes terrifying, but still new, like the look on his face now. Blood  crawls from underneath me on the bed like a root system. He takes my hands, and as I wait for towels and shoes, I try  to recall the eleven-week fruit. I think fig. Raised in a family lazy about religion— Lord have mercy and Good God Almighty  were the extent of our prayers, uttered for August humidity or thunderstorms on someone’s front porch in Tennessee—  I hedge my bets by believing in miracles: a seagull in the parking lot of a landlocked strip mall. Since moving to the beach,  we feed these same miracles popcorn from our fingers. Miracles on windowsills. As my husband attempts to speed down  the sand-blown highway, I imagine a fig weighs the same as this seagull’s heart in my hands. I talk to it about the weather. For when panic begins to vibrate the backs of your arms like they’re the trees and panic is whatever vibrates the trees, leafhoppers or helicopters, the psychiatrist tells you to fill a small bag with handwritten notecards promising this will end     this will not kill you  this no one ever died from and you add gum and headphones and a votive, citrus verbena, a bridal shower party favor. With masking tape and a Sharpie you write  Dymphna Dymphna, each side of the candle, and draw your best version of a bouquet of lilies. From patron saint of the nervous, the mad, the runaways, you’ll ask for intercession: Let you never again leave your nine-year-old niece at a concert inside the Georgia Dome and lie on a park bench, count to the right number of sirens or power lines just to be able to breathe. Let her never hold up your cell phone light, one in the thousands of stars. Let her never sway alone in the dark. Never notice you’re gone.           Jesus It is the rawest name I know     The Kool-Aid is sweet when a nigga summons savior     I know the grandbabies gave their lives to sin when granny whispers the lord over the belt before the beating  Maybe whosoever calls upon the name shall be saved from diabetes & child protective services  Maybe we waste our peace praying His name will be a fence where it ain’t nothing but space & opportunity Be a plate on a passover our fridge can’t afford His mercy, a meal His grace, leftovers for breakfast  Oh, I love How the name is exalted by the need of the nigga: Jesus Be a bus pass in the shadow of the valley of Detroit  Be a nap after wine  Be a cloud keeping the bullshit at bay  Something about the Lord always provides     always  Be our basic needs running over. The comet was a long-haired star  So quiet in the woods, headed back toward that girl from the future.  it had always been so quiet— It twisted through the sky, singing After.  How long had she been walking? It was not her mother, its pain no angel,  Who’d braided her hair? but shed intimate breath through the cold trees until  Maybe it was winter it went dense and changeable as the wind  and this was her cold neck, she kept in the pocket of her dress.  this her cold belly— Had this always been what she wanted: strange lie of light?  What was that in the sky? Over her it came calling  (It had always been so quiet) to tell or to burn,  That cry— to find her body  what could she say and be itself re-membered  but grackle, alder, afraid— and so she stopped between black wings to  tell me, tender, let me hold— open her hands. Let Me Pray     that Wolf will come as memory pressed in a nest of dark feathers, lifting eyes of soot. Wolf will be ghosts of the body, ghosts of a body’s hurt. Wolf will not know the language of hurt       the weave of a girl’s       of a girl’s       of my breath on stone  Wolf will speak only in snow and teeth Will only tell me a story rounding to curl in sleep       or lapping dreams at sleep’s wet flames— not a girl’s first house empty       her mother’s blue-rose body empty on the red rug       brown bottles empty and a girl’s       my trembling skin  (my hands       and my hands       on her blue-rose sleeves even after       years       shaking like stones)  Wolf will not know the mouth of my mother’s door the lace of the path outside     the hard ripple of starlings     in the air over the roof will not know me     know my body’s swerve in fear     Wolf will not  tell—  O my body how you ruin me     O Wolf how you come to take its place that you come again       into my skin find me here     blue-rose snarl and fur       is mercy       and a fierce soft beating. You think this is a poem where the wolf.  The forest, after all, is a sleeve of glass daggers.  You: the girl. Cold throat, wet shoes.  Wolf is the ghost of a hurt remembering itself. Is She. You can hear Her between trees.  You can see the ghost Her mouth was, weaving wet fur in the shards.  If the forest is an altar built in the crack of your Lost One’s femur,  then this is the moment when the girl is you kneeling before it.  Wolf says, The scarlet bird is the one with a scar in it.  Wolf says, Gather stones.  Is the end of the story of the wolf moving slowly across the sentence you have been speaking since before you were born.  You say what a stone says, in the pocket of your dress.  And forget you were ever a wing.  Wolf says nothing.  You think: was never here. I am tired of summoning my heritage out of a battered magician’s hat. Yaani, there are times I reach for history and come up empty. Yaani, it feels wrong to sing for my supper with a ghost’s mouth. Yaani, I have come to love belonging nowhere, I priest absence. Yaani, this mo(u)rning I arranged a bouquet for my other half. Yaani, I can multitask longing in every direction. Yaani, when you can give directions to a stranger, you are home. Yaani, when I planted a kiss on an Adam’s apple I entered Eden. Yaani, I know what it is to be expelled and fear it more than anything. Yaani, I taste the apple anyway. I am thrown every time. Yaani, the snake has no gender. I swallow the whole pregnant length. Yaani, to create a garden is to make a border. Even beauty is walled. Yaani, I refuse to make ugliness a refugee. Let them stay. Yaani, do not draw fixed lines around my origin. I came from water. Yaani, there are waves resonating ever outward. Forget the dirt. Yaani, meaning Arabs are forever transmuting tongue into ocean         to say we are here. There was a time when my ancestors would have been united knighted by the conqueror’s blade as Ottoman. Not Lebanese, not Turkish. I cannot imagine the ease of being only one thing. I am sure this too is a fantasy. In Beirut, a memorial is taking over a house where every bullet hole has been given a name, a shrine to the violence that (r)ejected my family. Only in light of this can you call it Paris, otherwise leave that imperial shade alone. They say people are afraid to speak of the civil war lest it spark back to life. The war is not taught. Who knew my family have been following official policy for years? They will be devast -ated to hear it. All my knowledge is myth-made, media driven, an inherited memory put through the dryer one too many times. It’s small now, so small, the colours faded and riddled with many perfect holes. I still wear it every day. There are always birds trying to come inside. I came inside. The door was half- open, the living room floor dressed in a flurry of feathers. A bird  had burst in, sure that a room must be like any other place–– but then my house with its beast’s jaw. Its hunger. Its practiced  growl and whir. The bird swelled with fear and shit everywhere, I mean  everywhere, carpets a splattered dictionary of panic. I found it huddled with the dishtowels, shivering.  Later I asked, why the dishtowels . My mother said  they must have been the right kind of soft. Like a nest, or grass––  grass, the softest thing we all share. And the bird a heartbeat threatening the sky. We cradled it to our chests in turns,  watched it flutter frantic and dissolve in the street’s chant of rooftops. Before this, another bird, brown, broken-necked,  limp at the lip of the garage. My father gathered it into a dustpan. I did not watch. And the first bird, a sound  gathered ruthless into a fist and rushing at the window as though it were air, beat at the pane, once––  To fly must be to defeat the body. To live everywhere and nowhere. John, I’ve been having this dream:  your room has grown into a house, complete with cement scars and a screen door. Outside, the punched  plums stinking, the finches snatching away their secrets. The room is just as it was. Nothing there  but the slump of my body pinned beneath the dark canopy of your grunting. One word and only my mouth  to forget it. My sternum a column of claws. John, I was so small to you, which would explain  why I felt too heavy to move, too still to want or not want. In the dream we’re on the porch, some bird bleeding  out in the grass: sparrow, kestrel. Does it matter? A rack of bullets limps your right hand. The jets spit  into the lazy sky. The bird isn’t dead yet. I invent a glint in its mouth’s gun-dark  every time I have the dream. Its body’s curdle and twitch. Any sign. I never go closer  to the bird, never try. At least the afternoon’s cool thrum. At least the grass, soft. Our house whirs  and you wrench me into it. You say, come in  now . Even after I wake I am thinking of the bird.  How I would have forgotten it if it were whole, unbroken. Miraculous, how its heart flocked  fluent into the dirt. It bled and bled. It bled because it could.  *  Tonight I am red for a world paled of red. I walk around like a tooth  in a mouth that’s still laving over a bitten tongue. My collarbones are proud  as knives. The dark is a dark which quarters everyone like melons. I kiss up one strange soft  gift of skin, then another, quick, my brain blackened with light, I kiss all the way  to the softest skin I can find, I try to keep it. I cannot keep it. All the way and still  I cannot stop. I want and want. I’m shivering. A limp pair of wings against hard glass. I can’t help it. I couldn’t  help it. I had to burst through the door, empty myself anywhere I could. My body  had to come in from the crooked sky. Had to stumble crooked through the house  to see if the house would whisper back, or twitch to life. Any sign. Isn’t that how it goes, John?  Enter something and you become it. In the dream you shot the bird because you could. Tonight,  I look down at your clenching hands, hung suddenly from my crooked wrists. In my heart  is a screen door with me on one side, every open beak I have ever known on the other.  They rush at me cawing, tongues thrumming with blood, claiming freedom, calling join us, join us.

What is miraculous is that a natural event like a stain from leaking water and a supernatural event like seeing Mary converge. -Chicago Tribune April 19th, 2005   Moonlight filters through streetlight and the whir of concrete under part-time alcoholics and late-night employees performs a kind of music.  Around Her the smell of population is replaced by pine incense and wilting flowers. The gifts of desperate prayer hover around Her salt-stained image  thick enough to eat. Below Her, peacefully kicking in his sleep, a man draped in blankets starts to dream that his children still dream of him.  It is not our place to ask why She reaches out her hand to comfort him. 1. When you receive him, receive him. He’s heavier than he looks and eager to meet you.  2. Wash him twice. Don’t be surprised by his forgiving body.  3. The softest part of his body is the belly. His hands, neck, and feet are calloused and won’t break.  4. His blood runs slowly. Make time for yourself and take breaks.  5. Don’t bother with staples or glue. His eyes have earned their rest.  6. Sew his mouth shut. He’s lived by wire and knows how to tease it out.  7. He often smiled even where there was little joy. Can you use that?  8. All of this will be more than you’re paid for, I can’t do anything about that.  9. Let me see him first. I need to be sure.  10. If you need more time, I’ll wait as long as he needs.  The leftover cake is temptation, Satan offering Christ the world in a water glass that hot desert day. Three times I am lured out of bed to open my mouth wide to the sweet thing, my father sleeping down the hall his words no shield.  The worst thing to happen to a woman is to get fat and lose her looks I am slicing another sliver and swallowing, pink sugar stuck against pink tongue, floor felled crumbs like manna sprung from heaven  And if you need proof just look at your mother Father in the doorway, something hard in his hand to beat me with  And you are shaping up to be just like her You do not need to eat so much until I obey him, in my disappearance to become wanted filling myself up with smoke as if it were the breath of life kissed into the first man as God’s own good truth. But now I know there are worse things, like holding close what will destroy me. Being with men who beat me down accordingly. My baby boy on visitation with one of them, his father. His bruises afterwards. Everything about the day was so obvious. You were wearing that “Nanfucket” shirt. The sky was full of grey gulls and plastic bags circling. Pastries lined the waxy café windows starting to get stiff. You laughed so hard at your own joke, coffee came out your nose. Something was leaking on the back porch of us. The room darkened and I turned a mechanical candle on. I thought I heard the air twinkling but it was someone in the alley, sweeping up shards of a broken Heineken bottle. You told me a forty-five minute long story about the carpet in your grandparent’s house, how it was vodka- soaked. The story ended with you in your apartment watching the Sopranos and crying. I couldn’t help feeling a bit jealous of your obsession with that town: the smoked-ham sandwiches, boys on boardwalk in cut-off jean shorts, Martin’s Casuals’ flashy suits flapping in the wind. I wanted some of that tenderness. But there were other things: your leopard print bedspread, the avenue ripening, your twisted bottom teeth, the next person who will handcuff themselves to this chair for you. Sinking, singing I pray to become more specific Leathery wings rub the blue Wind carries a hawk across the valley In an adjacent field I become the weather clumsy flight pattern winnowing I haven’t a drum or even a voice to join in soothing the air I land between milkweeds limbs outspread I wait for their antennae to prod to possess me. The zebra-bird flies over my half-napping face & lands in a crab apple tree   freckled with holes   Aloe green apples globed & swinging adorn hundreds of gaudy earrings I get dizzy from breathing with my eyes closed   The song doubles in my ears   A different bird with a red head stabs its face into the earth I want to be like that total in my wanting for you A breeze splits off & tangles above the stream A cloud that looks like a cowgirl boot comes & covers the sun. Inside me a cup fills with blood     I empty into a truck stop toilet white porcelain stained briefly red     Atlanta haze tows the hours out What tradition for a futureself If I imagined chestnuts spilling down my back a flowing, a pony-like I was wrong     a rock occupies my brain Lichen-headed, crusty I remain fruitful from my body I gather wine vials of balsam grape skins a glove compartment full When the census came,  they called us Caucasian.  When we went to school,  they called us Arabs.  When we met the Arabs,  they called us Catholics.  When Athenos brand started making hummus,  they called us Greek  and when we made spanakopita on Christmas,  we called it sabanegh .  When we made Moroccan couscous,  we called it Israeli  And when the towers fell, we were Americans.  And when the towers fell, we were afraid.  When we were asked at the airport,  we were Lebanese.  And when the people who asked us were Lebanese,  we feigned the accent all the way to our respective gates.  When the war began, we were Syrians.  I have been Syrian for three years, since I heard a girl of three  washed up on a tepid Turkish shore like a cold cup of coffee,  reciting the Lord’s prayer in her Levantine tongue.  When churches burned and the Copts bled,  we were Egyptian for decades.  When my cousin was born with maple-colored curls,  we called her blonde  and when we wanted boyfriends and girlfriends,  our parents called us Americans  and when they passed the history test and swore on the Bible,  we called our parents Americans.  When the forefathers founded a new homeland,  they called the people who lived there Indians  They fashioned some stars, and they called it America  After the massacres, they called them Native Americans  After our massacres, no one called us Native Israelis.  When we elected a Black man president, we called it progress.  We don’t hate anybody,  my mother always said,  What we hate is being called terrorists as we tend the nativity  What we hate is being erased from Google maps  What we hate is by any other name, still called genocide.  Aren’t we all Palestinian?  In the way we are all lonely and nationless when we are dead  reduced to bodies, to be swallowed up by the earth ?  In America, indigenous people were confined to reservations until 1924  In America they still call it the Department of Indian affairs  In America they’ve called it Gaza, the West Bank, the Palestinian territories  On Google maps they don’t call it anything at all  When my grandmother is asked where she is from,  she answers in broken English  Betlehem, where Jesus born!  I stand to correct her.  She is from Palestine, where your Jesus was born,  where your Jesus walked, where our children are  blown up with phosphorus.  She is from Palestine, land of Mahmoud Darwish, Turkish coffee,  and the freshest falafel you will ever taste.  Say it for the middle school teacher who made a point  of mispronouncing my last name: Palestine.  Say it for the U.S. census that calls us white: Palestine.  Say it for the stuttering newscaster: Palestine.  Say it for the bumbling history professor: Palestine.  Say it for the Biblically challenged: Palestine.  Say it for the little child born in a manger: Palestine.  Say it for the people in the back row: Palestine.  Say it for the people in the front row: Palestine.  Say it and say it again and again, the letters  becoming softer in your mouth.  falasteen, ya bladi  When my grandmother is tired, it sounds like a swallow  fluttering outward from her throat. The olive trees  were wiped out parcel by parcel,  you may have noticed, sucking the pit  out of a people  broken and spread  across a butcher block.    What will become of the sweet  creatures of the olive trees, the sweet  sweet ladies who tend them?    A family mourns  groves of livelihood.  Tending them in autumn  when the bulbs burst  from heavy branches  turning the atmosphere fragrant as oil.  Pruning them, doting upon  even the smallest leaf—a sign  of something living.    And I tell you this: Palestinian bodies  may stretch from one edge of the earth  to the other—an aunt in Honduras,  one in Texas—    meanwhile a woman carries a basket  into the final field of her nation. How was I to know     walking     that the forest around us would deepen and black out the stars?  But we could hear the river    the rustles in the brush You pulled a lump of clay from the ground  It glowed blue     smelled like rot— a lump     a light to see by  That’s licorice fern I told you     that’s skunk cabbage and there’s a used-up fox     The lump in my hands thickened  once you saw the fox opened on the ground Grew too big to hold     I stretched it     draped  it over my shoulders     tied it around my waist but it was heavy     and I sank to the ground  put my head to the wet ground Leave it you said let’s go     It stank like the spent fox  But I couldn’t     I needed it now I stretched     pulled     hollowed it  into a boat     I heaved in the river Get in I told you     scared now     but you  would not get in     Let’s go I said but I would go alone  Go down the river and out of you unable to remember—had you pulled it out of me?  Had we found it when we woke? Had we made it? Had you put it in my hands?       Bruised fruit  to her father, to Shreveport  uncles who took her in at nine  when her mother died.  Goodbye    curls flying, skirt twirling, about  to collapse in tall grass, limbs  loose, late summer heat, goodbye    memory, cigar smoke, bourbon,  uncles, the places she’s forgotten  they touched her,    as she raised me, they stung,  those berries growing  wild in her mouth, how    berry they tasted, strawberry  rashes leaking down the arms  and legs she covered even    in mid-summer sun,  mine and hers, praying  nothing showed. Terrain    In the trail of a finger  sliding over a map, chummy    with any field, stream,  rock, ghost,    young girl’s skin,  your tobacco stained finger    pressing heavy inside  nights cold with moon,    plowing fields,  rushing into crevices, shedding    seeds, disturbing undergrowth,  trailing over    folds of my flesh, leaving  the smell of things turned inside out. Turn your head sideways & it looks like birds, fish, flesh—just water,  just air. A nest of black gloves, fingers curling toward the heart-come here. Come here. Now. The threats  of childhood: belt, wooden spoon, daddy’s fist. The same hand that brands the skin removes  the splinter, cracks eggs into omelets, the unformed cluck wriggling out. The canal:  frozen water, stilled bridges. Nothing lifts in winter. Snow swirls, scarves wet from breath crystalize.  All has become so pointless yet this isn’t true. Last time I dreamed I dreamed of kindness & wet  hands. (My ex-husband.) All is full of love & warmth & I am afraid to lose it. And, if loss is inevitable,  then, it is here now. A body floating toward shore. A missing sock found in the oven.  When the dark holds like a wet wool glove remind me to tell myself to offer  protection. When tulips are open for a friend’s hysterectomy. For a friend’s circumcision.  For a friend for a friend for a friend. I take away the first layer & feed it to my dog. I skin  it, drape it over a fence & build a fire. I debone the chest, remove the heart. I chew on its feet  while looking up at the stars. (I dream) my teeth fall out. (I dream) my hair falls out. (I dream) I cannot  move. The heart (thumps) in its walrus belly. The belly churns in salty anguish. Gums bleed.  Teeth pull like tweezers the hangnail. Simple things we cannot let be simple, anymore. Every time I hear the band REO Speedwagon I’m reminded of someone else’s high school memory, the one where they sit alone on the school bus forlorning out the window, Walkman in hand, and the driver slows but ultimately passes their crush’s house cause it’s September and she moved in July without saying goodbye, but the truth is I never hear songs popular in my high school: Black Sheep, N.W.A, Public Enemy, the Geto Boys—blasted by white farm boys who’d make little of their lives doin whip-its in the woods. Boys cloaked in varsity jackets, football jerseys, their blue jeans half off their asses, bunched at their ankles like foreskins. And to me, a city girl moved up north to the country, whose tattered Club Beverly Hills sweater and bangs stood high and alone in those hallways, or forested state lands, where I’d get drunk on Genny Light cause that’s what we did here, gather around a keg carried by someone’s older brother, spit words to songs that weren’t about us and never would be. There I abandoned Catholic virtues and Latin masses, embracing instead the necks of boys to see how many I could kiss in one night, softly pushing away clammy fingers wriggling toward my breasts and panty line like tentacles. There in the New York mountains we’d pass out in half-propped tents, wake to the crackling of last night’s firewood rekindled, humus strewn with red and white cups opening their mouths towards us like flowers. Marjorie Baker and I walked after rain to the lake we didn’t know was manmade, plunging white feet into rimless water to hear our birdboned voices cry out from cold and nothing in answer.  Both of us girls, technically.                                                                        Age eleven, my hips wiry and boyish. Her breasts already full, her arms sloped and rounded.  I almost laughed when she, a full foot taller, sank hip-deep into mud,                                                             grasping at reeds, legs whelmed by flooded grass all but washed up and hoared.  A child’s fear of death: dying where no one                                                                    can see you.  I put all my weight into pulling her by the forearms,                             screaming and digging nails in her skin, fearing I would have to live with                     that vision of half her body sticking up out of the ground.  But soon the earth loosed and out she came, short nothing but a flip-flop, and we ran back in tears thinking we had edged a place we could not recover from.  Unrecoverable: at age fifteen, I’m driven to an empty house by a man in the dark. Everything below my hips paralyzed, blackened. It is me half-sunk.  The mud back then a pelvic rehearsal, unreal, in the end nothing like the panic-sound of leaves torn by deer against my window before sleep, my chest under pressure, under the shoulders of a man who locked all the doors. I like the sound of my name / in your American mouth / the way it ping pongs off your tongue / its chopstick and porcelain clatter / how your lips fold around / my name’s rhino horn-edges / as high as a pagoda / or a horse, the one I ride around on / as you pelt me with your chinks and ni haos / in my country, my name / is no more beautiful / than the penny-clink sound of your teeth / my name is an aberration / is the sweat staining a White Rajah’s shirt / as he tours the plantation / in the Malayan heat / my rubber-tapper grandmother / looking up from the herringbone cuts / to dream of black tea and biscuits / my name is the staccato / of a Molotov cocktail / lobbed by Malay youths / as my Chinese family cowered / inside their tailoring shop / later swept up the broken glass / used the shards to etch the details / of that night into the syllables / of my name, the one I wield / like an icon, the one that wells up / like a Chinese goldfish / in my throat when asked / where I belong: that spills over / like ink knocked over a sheet / of silk paper as an old man / puts down his calligraphy brush / and sighs, goes to wash his hands / pulls out a fresh sheet of paper / to begin again. In this version of the story, I pile my hair up and pull out the coffin nail from the back of my neck. My fangs worn clean by my catlike tongue. I cut out my rotting parts, pretty myself up with frangipani water. My accomplice: the night, the frogs refusing to sing.   I wander the hushed village, looking for food left outside on banana leaves: a chicken bone to chew on. A glass of milk to swig. The wide-eyed shape of a man hitching up his sarong, the open plain of his arms: the ones I gather myself into as I lean into his neck and lick   his throat clean. How his eyes will stay with me for days after, even though I kiss his lids shut, the white of them – traced by the sudden flash of halogen and sickles, a new widow’s cry – later, two pinpricks in the trees, watching me undress for the morning.   How his footsteps will always follow a step behind: stopping when I stop, running when I run. The ghost of his hands always caressing mine, tilting back another man’s head as I feast. His mouth, the shape of it. When I sleep I dream of teeth. I feel it every day. But I am lucky.  Do you visit it often?   No…10 years ago, once.  How do you define it?   I don’t watch news.  Do your parents visit?   Yes, once a week.  What do you do?   Burn charcoal, smoke argileh.  What do you want?   To be a teacher.  What have you learned?   To be.   Is there work?   Inshallah (no).  What are you worth?   My heart and my tongue. A soldier tells a story about a father beating  his son in the street. He asked the father, why?  Because my son threw stones at your truck.  hole of broken teeth he will answer a car accident/ face to  dashboard, a peeling stripe             of chest collapsing red into lines/  solemn for contention  a stone’s throw away/  the son holds onto      jido’s  a tree begins  with a seed  to hold him or, cradle to     relief before he clenches down to fractured canines  ground into bubble gum arabic how he licks     the dust the same  in a stopped car/ unsure whether teeth or debris how the ground his mouth  to sand,      commanding defense   or chewing on regret/  to repent, stillness as if                     ease.   In every animal’s dream, there is a  blueness– a place where water  meets sky in the way that lover    meets lover.    In the meadow, two deer meet  nose to nose, telling each other  how the forest will end.    How very quiet.    Between each day, the dreams  become bluer– a line strung  between the trees and sun.    A bitterness sweetens    when the moon comes up. A few days shy of eight months old, you’re watching your hands  turn the laminated chart of local birds we keep on the coffee table. You guide it to your lips  and hold it there for the few seconds you can to gum the corner  featuring the Eastern Meadowlark, supposed year-round bird I’ve never seen.  Everyone’s gone to work, and you and I on the floor face each other  in our way of not manufacturing custom curtain rods or handling  customer service calls or leveling ground for an essential structure.  You’re giggling because you can sit now without tipping,  and when your hands disappear, you can make them come back.  And the Meadowlark’s song I’ve found on a website for you to listen to  autorepeats its pitch of tiny hunger, collected perhaps years ago  by a microphone hidden in the grass near the opening of its arch over nest  of woven weeds. I’m just talking now, my large little   starling , knowing English carries only enough to comfort you—  my words, like your fingers, always arriving again after they’ve gone hiding. Before the tenuous muslin of her marriage had flickered away, before the piano,  one morning, you and I were becoming in our mother’s favorite shoes. Left alone  in summer, the house emptied, our nightshirts draped to our knees, we went to her closet:  open boxes, the pumps glossy and upright as prizes in an auto show. You imitated her,  sauntering across the cream-colored carpet until you fell. Then when I fell over you  we laughed until you pushed me off. You looked and said, Do you sometimes  wanna go someplace else. I said, Where. Then you stood up in your heels and practiced. I take all 23 bobby pins out of my hair, begin to shave my legs. The razor tells me that Lindsey is right: I can’t ever go back again.  In the summer I watch a pot over-boil, and somewhere, the chain breaks for the first time. At 10PM, there is still light, and my voice cracks again.  The windows are open. I can’t stop looking at the same map, thinking about the tall grass I’ve never seen in person. I’m reminded of what I lack again.  Yes, my heartbeat is driving me mad right now. A friend asks me to think about something else. Every radio seems to give that lovesick feedback again.  The word “you” becomes its own refrain every night. This is all for you. For you. I’m afraid to tell you I love you. I love you. I begin to pack and unpack again.  There won’t be a home after the pieces, Lydia, I tell myself. Your arms are already overflowing. He is still quiet. Maybe it’s time to backtrack again. the elusive dark : slow curve of a mother’s spine : riverbank solid enough to stand : home a starsilver river of arms  my mother’s riverbend is subtle & soft : her arms wet firefly light : home the far shore of her heart & i : the traveler boatless  //  a green fish rises from my mother’s water : shows me how to take apart my bones : how to break & reposition them to make of me a boat :  ribcage hull : femur mast : scaffolding of tibia & spine : if i leak i fill the gaps with teeth : the fish says if i use my skin for sails i won’t need my mother’s body :   yes but who will brush  my hair    Does it matter now that I come from hand-me down shorts, tattered shirts, trips to Goodwill with grandma drinking Little Hug Fruit Barrels, high fructose corn syrup swimming on my tongue, singing the song of need, of wearing America’s colors on my body like a dream my parents regretted. My mother spoke in prayer for my undocumented uncle, handed us ketchup sandwiches, hung hope on a clothesline in our basement. I promised to grow and grow and grow as quick as a cavity become more than an immigrant’s struggle, more than my parent’s sacrifice, more than my mother’s red-faced shame when the immigration officer tells her we do not recognize Palestine as a country. Sometimes I cry at this world, how we dangle from one place to the next, always en route, like God carved the words deportation and exile into the milk we suck from our mother’s breasts as babies. Does is matter now that I grew and held the weight of my parent’s eviction until I made a home out of blue skies and clouds. Some nights my bones wake me and ask Noor, where are you from?  which country? I tell them to sleep, to dream of my father’s country in my country there are checkpoints now, there are birds that leave the bodies of small children. Does the weather have you down?  Might I recommend a glass of water?  Might I recommend the love of someone  you don’t? Allow me to suggest  a night class in consciousness.    Please, throw glitter in the piano.  Please, don’t turn around. It’s time  to create a self-portrait. Do you prefer to use  pen or pencil? Remember: people’s eyes  are halfway down their face.    Pen or pencil, it doesn’t matter.  You may use one with each hand,  an icicle between your breasts.  They just invented a kind of glass  stronger than most metals.    They made it by suspending  the combination of things in the air  & using a laser as a spatula to mix it.  Step outside, watch smoke move  slowly through a spiderweb. Leaves    stick to other leaves. Sweat cools  on your face. Your pockets are full  of sugar packets, matchbooks from  other countries. Call to mind the taste  of stamps, the smell of gasoline.    You’ve never felt so bright  & sleepless, raw & clean. i brought you back spices       you brought me back seeds  so i’m the one who has to wait  as usual     in spring the earth will seem as if it has turned to gold    in the meantime           you cook the air delicious, dancing around    in your against-the-rules impossible skin    the music says sei frei  be free  so i’m just following instructions    when i flail into you—      stay mortal      i say  stay wherever lets you be hungry then eat then be  hungry again—    looking at you is like  looking at myself with great vanity    in the metaphor pond  i can touch your hands with my hands forever    you are the only patience i know     keep soil wet  the orchestra sewing furiously  the orchestra rowing furiously   until rains fall        In class we had partners and the partners had tubes of anesthetized fruit flies sorted by eyes.  Our task was to feed them and gas them and count them, to sort and combine red eyes with white.  Three days passed, then seven, then nine, and we never returned, my partner and I. The idea was hers, but it might’ve been mine.  Into the hall of lockers lined we took our tube, multi multiplied, and with one move we set them free and kissed our Biology grade goodbye. The blue buckets on the shower floor were useless against the drought. I dismembered the hydrangeas in the garden and put them in my dress pockets. I left my mother’s house. I crossed the deadened brush along the highway where the unclothed body of a woman was once found by the headlights of two teenagers. I dropped a trail of hydrangea heads like a crop circle in the dust. This is how Seoul must have looked: dark patches of village soil covering kimchi jars buried in even rows. Except here three generations of time have made barren the wilderness of what birthed me. I looked for a body but instead found the entire landscape a grave: the cashier at the grocery shoving my pears into plastic, the man on the phone trying to sell me a house with no windows. During the Joseon dynasty women fortunate enough to bear sons flaunted their breasts in crowded village markets. When I learned this I held my mother’s backyard oranges silently to my chest, dreamt of rice paddies draining from the highest terrace. Grains arched and shivering. Weary as the oar risen from the river. Ancestors, tell me where you have collected the water which from its blade has ascended. I want to return to that other life. It has & always will be  a hundred-dollar bill      Yes,  this is the instrument of cultured grief:  faded paper       snot-reeked and spun  into the shape of a pen cap –  now observe the undercurrent,  that violent grip of warmth barreling  their bodies into silence & also  those beached whales sputtering up  around me      pleading  for one more wave & I know  what you’re thinking;  what is glamorous about  a room pregnant  with people sinking  into the floorboards, thinking themselves  as joyful as a school of parrotfish?  I can tell you this:  when the tide breaks, the body  glistens & begs      to be beaten again  with salt. The salt tastes       richer  the second time around. I can tell you  when I found myself midocean  with a wad of a washed-out hundred  crushed between my thumbs	I could not weep.  There was so much music in that dark.  I heard my mother sing & for the first time  since her absence, I laughed. It was,  of course, at nothing. The room full of  drug-thirst dripping at the seams.  It was, of course,    not my money.  I was penniless and craving something  still     I cannot tell you I will ever find. field guide of the color green            Some ewes will reject a lamb, often one of twins, as if to say, this is all I can do but farmers force the reject back on the teat, time and again, until she relents and if she won’t then a dog is let loose and the barn door is closed and in the cold, dark stall the mother must decide what life is worth. This poem is about a Will I was privileged to draft for a woman back in the day when I was still a practicing estate planning attorney.   I know I’m too old to wear leopard skin prints. Write that I lost my only son last month. And my Executor should give his car to my daughter. She’s bipolar.   Write:           I own forty acres in Georgia. Write:           I got it under my aunt’s Will. Write:           I haven’t seen it for years. Write:           Horses, peaches, cousins.   My son’s name was Marvin, for marvelous. Don’t laugh, but after I had my daughter, Mary Lou, I got pregnant by accident when we thought I couldn’t.   Write:          My wedding ring, 14 karat gold with a one full karat diamonds. Look at it—see?—a full karat.   Write:          That ring must go my daughter. Write:          She can sell it,I don’t care. Write:          Not out of lack of affection for my other kin…or whatever you said. Write:          I bought the car for my son. It’s still in his name. Write:          I lived with my aunt and uncle from the time I was two years old. Write:          I was the one that took care of them when they was sick. Write:	         I might sell that Georgia property. It’s mine.   I’d have to chase my cousins off the property if I want to sell it. They sure hate paying me rent, but they won’t want to see it gone.   Write:         I haven’t even cleaned out my own house since last month. My daughter helps me clean it, off and on, when she feels up to it. Lately she hasn’t felt up to it.   Write:           I want to create a trust for my daughter. I don’t have no name for the trustee yet.   Put yourself in as trustee.   Is my lipstick on crooked? I’m a small woman, but still strong. My daughter’s not strong and she has spells. Don’t put in how old I am. You don’t need that, do you?   Write:           O God	          O God          O God.   No, take that out.                 So I’m in the red-  neck of the woods,  and this is the part of the country  where people aim their rifles  at autumn. What I would give  to be that season  with so many weapons.    Here, where all wild-  life startles easily, I miss  the bullseye on every rabbit’s back.  I grieve the living  I fail to dress  and undress like small children.    When I drive back to the farm,  it’s dark enough  that I could be anywhere.    I kill the gas  and lower my head-  lights like a sheep  bringing its mouth closer  to the earth. Some summers the hotel was closed due to insufficient water. So the Glacier Point Hotel and McCauley’s old Mountain House, like the famous Firefall, became only memories.      History says that a man stood at the bottom of a cascade and, as a signal, intoned: Let the fire fall. As if this could be done by mere hands; exposure to the elements teaches even the noblest skeptic that fire burns through everything given enough time. Anything can become historical; all it must do is stop. History says—and History is always saying something—an entrepreneur built a hotel on top of a mountain that History, decades later, would call a park. There were bonfires, and when those died down, the tradition of boys kicking flames over a cliff became a sensation that people would pay to experience. History says the park caught up with the spectacle, disallowed it, called it a fraud, unnatural. The rangers must not have seen it with their eyes, must have heard rather than known the splendor of it. When the last fire fell, it was snowy, and no one was there as witness. No one to tell the fire what to do, no lenses to capture, even momentarily, the weight of what can be, still falling. Jesus is so quiet on Chef Menteur Highway as the wine bottle conks the back of her head. The Wal-Mart sign flashes us, the darkness so black, I can only  see the white of her teeth as she shrieks. I signal to the police hoping they will see me summoning from the rear window. The tin foil covering  Jesus’ leftovers tears and the mashed potatoes spill on the backseat. Collard greens stain my jeans. The blue and red sirens pull  our car over and the tires’ halt stops our faceless father from striking again. I am ready to break the scent with my teeth.  I breathe out nothing but, the gas light cut on. I thought we’d crash, in the voice of the child I am who wants nothing  but a family to continue living in the type of quiet a fracture can give to the throat. The officer pats my shoulder, turns his mouth  up in a watermelon grin. On the ride home, I reach across the front seat’s threshold past Jesus’ hand—which is enveloped in God’s—  to turn on the radio. God pushes his thumb through the hole in her hand with the same force Deniece Williams pushes out a note:   Oh love, Oh love, stop making a fool of me, He belts to Jesus because singing is the closest some men come to crying. I cannot say  anything else. The night ripples through us. I’m Always So Serious    which is to say in the winters I dream of owning a multi-floored mansion in New Orleans. Specifically one on St. Charles Ave with a wrap around porch and white pillars that would only see the likes of me if I were the maid, the midwife, the family mechanic, Archie Manning, the maintenance worker or the mailman trusted enough to know the gate’s nine digit passcode and leave the mail resting on the family’s rain-weathered mahogany rocking chair. In this particular  dream, I’m the mailman. The marigolds’ red tongues lick the legs of the chair as I leave the mail on one of its non-refurbished, lead-painted arms. Their green necks rapidly invade the eggshell painted porch like any poor soldier in need of his salt. I rip one from the ground for the sake of killing, look it in its yellow center, a vibrant blister, before I rub it between my knuckles and render it a freshly ground thing.  Looking back, this poem was only supposed to be about my sinuses, how even in my dreams, I sneeze at the sight of untended weeds, flowers whose mouths unfold under the brazen light of the sun. The nightmare is supposed to be my allergies, how they only allow me to love what blooms from a distance, but in every dream those vibrant marigolds  keep growing, their vines are needle-thin tumors that keep stretching crazily onto the porch, keep making the rocking chair nervous at its own home. When I see that rocking chair, I see blood. It rocks like a heart- beat running from whatever is inside that mansion, or behind it with a whip.       Man with viola drags bow across viola. Viola’s throat fills with sparrows.  Man in chair weeps because viola’s throat fills with sparrows.  When grandfather’s face slips behind hands long as harps,  man in chair weeps, and child on floor fears it gone. When grandfather’s  face slips beyond train’s window, sea is a roil of motes, and child in train  fears it gone. Boy across shores will not understand when grandfather’s  face slips behind flame  until, in splinter between earth, mind;  cello, viola, made of hours, sing it must be it must  be it must be; oh it must be it must be oh must it be…    Man with viola delves wood. Draws psalms from it.  Man in chair wades sea sore with sparrows.  And tongue of the earth  drags across the mouth of ash  between earth, ash with long harp  hands. I made a man from clay and he turned me into bone. Let me bury myself aadam under his skin. Broke all my other faces to fit into a home he ibrahim’ed from straw and sunlight. I followed a boy to a pair of mountains and he left me in the sand. Ran seven times between their aching breasts. I ran so far I forgot my own God. My name spilling out like oil. Turned me dirty Zamzam 2 against the belly of a desert. I ran so far for a man I crumpled myself into a holy book and he chewed me into dynamite.     1.

A press  of lips isn’t enough –  but this is before the hanging &  the hundreds of other ways of learning  that lamentation is just another name  for preservation.  Is this the first instance where a man  who loved another man had to die  because of the impossibility of  happiness?  Drink, Judas: there are worse crimes. There I was, crying in the laundromat. We had a washer/dryer combination shoved in a nook of our tiny bathroom, but I had to leave. We’d fought about the movie The Big Blue. He thought it was absolutely stunning. I thought it hated women: the blond woman always screaming and crying, wanting something, her feathered hair a mess, and then there was this clean, quiet space where the men dove into the big blue water, away from all domestic fussiness, away from the noise. I was watching the soapy wheels of the washers, moving all that cloth around in messy grey spirals. Sylvia Earle appeared at that moment, laughing at how I could cry so much water while still doing laundry. She went down deeper in the ocean than anyone in history, but most people don’t know her name. (You know Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong because they went up into the holy white sky, clean and light as if you burn off sins as you speed towards the moon and sun, as if you purify in the brighter blue, closer to heaven. But she, like a woman, went into the earth’s depths, plunged into dark water, let it envelop her, untethered herself as she walked the ocean floor.) I recognized her from an article, so I smiled back when she smiled at me, and said, “Thank you for your service.” It seemed like the right thing to say, but it wasn’t. I kind of blubbered at her, spilled my story across the laundry room floor like tipping buckets. Wet her thoroughly, and felt my own puddles pulling down the ankles of my jeans. She told me I was right about the movie. There’s so much archetype getting in the way, the stereotypes choking us like weeds. She told me it was where sunlight fades and darkness begins to take over, like deepest twilight or earliest dawn, still enough light penetrates clear ocean water in the middle of the day when she made the big dive. That soft glow was the sky above. There was a flash, sparkle, and glow of creatures. Some corals grow like giant bed springs from the ocean floor, taller than people. Little rings of blue fire pulse all the way down them. At first they kept the submarine headlights on, but she made them turn them off so she could see the firefly light. So many large corals on the sea floor, all alive, some pink, some orange, some yellow, some black, like a flower garden. Red crabs hang on a great sea fan like shirts on the line, in a little bit of current, slowly moving. Eels wrap around the base, ethereal. By this time I was mesmerized, a mermaid, anesthetized to my former pain. The neon sign in the window was backwards, but reminded me of the blue pulsing lights. The puddles were gone, the grey swirled linoleum restored to dryness. My laundry folded. Sylvia told me, she was on the bottom of the ocean for two and a half hours. Buzz told her that was also the time they had to walk on the moon, two and a half hours, but what they did not have on the moon was this avalanche of life. Everywhere, little fish with lights down the side, the colorful corals, little burrows of creatures dwelling in sediments on the seafloor, water like minestrone except all the little bits keep us alive. The first time you came inside me, my body  didn’t know what to do. My gut flooded    full with a water that poured out clean for days.  When Moses struck the stone a second time,    all the people still drank, but God hurled out  a new curse. The thing you need to know    about God is how frantic he is to be unknowable.  When my wife & I thought we were pregnant,    we exodused to the Grand Canyon. At its bottom,  a gray stream trickled over our feet. Our necks    grew stiff from craning back, sun-blind, surrounded  on all sides by what that water had done. Her empty belly    cupped in my palms, I divined names for our changeling  from the desert plants. Sage . Juniper . Nine months later,    we divorced, divvied up the DVDs & silverware.  Moses never did enter the promised land, the only reason    being that he thought he could force God’s hand,  thought that any old stone could quench his thirst.    On the cold porch, I am hushing your wailing son  while you sleep. Daddy , he bawls, Daddy.    He tries to wriggle out of my arms, stretching  towards your warm chest. I purr my love    to a child not mine, hum a lullaby  for this screaming sack of desire.        The first time I saw my husband, he was dancing,  his son cradled to his chest with one hand, the other  cupped, upturned to God. His eyes were closed, lips  mouthing indecipherable prayers, silent & worshipful    as a fig. How could I not fall in love? My favorite fruits  have always been the ones that couldn’t grow here, the sad  potted lemon tree. Look, every houseplant I’ve ever had  is dead, not from neglect, but over-watering. I’m trying    to figure out what language God speaks. It’s a silly question, impossible  as asking how the desert looks to a banana tree. Once I plucked  at God’s vocal cords, & they purred at a frequency right at the edge  of human hearing. The dog was going crazy, licking at my hands.    The hum was gone before I could even close my eyes. In my childhood  church, we knew God was speaking when our tongues shuddered out  wet, mangled noises we couldn’t comprehend. The whole sermon,  I would just stare at the wooden door behind my father, my brain    tugging symbols from its meaningless wood grain. If I closed one eye,  the swirls & ripples would wrinkle into Jesus’ stern face. When I closed  the other, if my father bellowed at precisely the right pitch, I could see  a goat-headed Satan. One time, at the peak of my father’s crescendo—    he was hopping, hurtling across the altar, descending feverishly  into the unmoved audience—three bats flew out of the vent  & began to halo around his head. I had always imagined it was  some forgotten tongueless god that lived in the church’s cellar    behind the cold metal door. After worship, while my father called  the exterminator, I kneeled in the basement, my ear pressed tight  against the heavy door. If I knocked just right, the other side  would flutter darkly, their whisper of wings almost forming a word. What I remember about the cornfields  is their smell, how I knew I was home  when their sulfur smoked into my nose.  The rock I dug from the fields, I palmed    in my dirty hand, spun it through the air,  purpling my sister’s jaw. She ran. I hid  behind the open front door, hushed  there for hours, pretending not to hear    my father’s shouts jangling the door  frame. When I did sneak out & peek  from the window, my mother was waving  her hands at the police. Strangers    were hollering my name in the streets.  I inched back behind the door, hundreds  of chemical punishments crop-dusting  through my skull. I admit I did hear    when my mother wailed into the phone,  pacing right by me: He must be in the fields.  I watched dusk eat the sky, watched  the cornfields shuck the neighbors out    empty-handed. From the door’s slight  crack, I watched my mother come inside  & slump against my father’s chest,  watched as he held her with one hand,    easing the door shut with the other.  Maybe I would do it all over again  just to study how her face muddled,  watch how it split & split & split again    as she yanked my arm into a hug,  wrenching a tight handful of my hair.  You stupid boy , she hissed. Stupid,   stupid boy , kissing every inch of my face. Sneak your mother’s sharpest knife into the sanctuary.    While everyone else prays, slash a perfect golden rectangle from each page.    On one of the scraps, draw filthy pictures of St. Paul & his thorn.    Fold another into the raven who refused to return to Noah’s hand.    Tear the remnants into strips. Write a dirty joke. Write your mother’s most secret fear. Write your unspoken name. It’s okay if they all say the same thing.    Pretend to be a prophet in a dry spell. Eat as many leftover hymns as you can until your stomach goes sour.    Stop. Listen to the pastor’s opening reading, the Gospel of Matthew, the fifth chapter & thirtieth verse.    Slice off your right hand. Hide it in the hymnal’s hollow. Don’t be alarmed when the fingers twitch up into a fist. Close the book. Slide it back in place behind the pew.    Stand with the congregation. Raise your good hand to God before it too goes bad.    Sing. You don’t need to look. You know these words by heart. The first time I went to vote for president, I returned to the suburbs, waited in line at the elementary school, ahead of the table  where three old white ladies flipped through check-marked pages. I stepped up when one of them asked for my name,  and as I had long learned to do by then, I tiptoed to peer over the list to search for the twenty letters my parents tagged  to my birth certificate. I pointed to it and the woman’s face slowly recoiled into embellished dread, into: oh my god. what is this—  she slid the sheet to the others to share her amused horror, now morphed into a blaring exchange of exaggerated tries  to pronounce it. Other voters swiveled to watch this riot, to listen to sounds ridiculed, pushed out of the women’s mouths  like it was phlegm. A gymnasium of citizens waited for me to speak, not much different than the time I handed my seventh grade teacher  the slip, who pressed it to his eyes, then extended it in a gesture of theatrical repetition, until he concluded: I’m not going to say this;  a new student in front of a classroom of Samanthas and Jonathans, how was I to respond but with a body full of apology;  we don’t assign our own nicknames. It was only one instance in a lifetime of carrying the guilt  of an innocent thing, a bitter inconvenience I forced onto the lips of those expecting a piece of cake.  Had I known when I was born—I thought when I was twelve— I would have cried to my mother that here, a foreign name  is attempted with reluctance, like a disease hyphenated or a dictator deceased. But that evening, on Election Day, in the hushed wait for me to answer,  I said: this, is from the Arabic root for blessing, and this, last name, ancient, from the word for leaning,   and this, middle name here, is good. It means good, means handsome, and you will hear it most among Muslims. Yes, Muslims,   mostly Shiite Muslims, that’s minority sect Muslims, but, of course, I was talking about the name on the presidential ballot. On the stalled train, I think of the exclamation mark, its Latin origin—so I have read—from the expression for joy, io, which Medieval copyists jotted at the end of sentences to signify triumph, cheer, delight, hurray, which over time others decided to stack the i over the o, which the 15th century printing press stamped, note of admiration, which 1970 typewriters finally came with its own key for it, but besides this I know nothing else of its history; there is just my own wonder over how one begins to create a visual that encases it: the trademark equivalent of a heart shriek, the character form of the eager bounce in a heartbeat; it seems arbitrary to fasten two letters and claim this a sign for emphasis; on the stalled E train after midnight, he nods in exhaustion, half asleep, he appears older when he is this tired, like a new father— I daydream—in those first weeks tending to his newborn, and when fatigue finally takes him, he slumps, stretches on the empty seats to the right of him, his face drops into my lap, I arrange my thigh for his pillow, and glance at his body, and it is suddenly obvious—his legs unfolded, his torso un-crooked, his neck unbent, all of him drawn straight like a line, stacked against his head in my hands, like a circle filled in, and at once, from this angle, both the image itself and the inspiration—a symbol for joy        Hills flatline in the rearview.  Your hand resting into mine. Headlights.  An exile of clouds.   Picture this: downriver a man guns his truck. Everything smells like wings.  Now picture him one morning wearing skirts of stunted light.    No. Even less.  Crows shattered like crumbs across our one good road.   Speech fucks the air with a proof of us.  Or. The gap between my front teeth is the exact width of a zipper.    Trust me.   Sheets. Rubbed red thighs. Roll. Rain obsesses itself. Down the wood. Pinned up against the window. Yes. Crests. Yes. Shudders shut.   Lightsource whisper. Shackle me back to the dashboard.  & do you have the negatives. & why.   I did shave my legs. Brine-diesel. Tobacco half-chewn & left to stench in a sawed can of coke.  They speeched & was an already. Smear some sun in the cut. Grin.   In the town where we buried my grandmothers, the collective noun for faggots is also a murder .   Heavens horizon, then bruise, then rust. I say your name            into the mirror  ( rosewater,  dogwood,  houndstooth )  & slip my fingers          through whose  tremor of hair & whose       hair is that  in my mouth         in your open mouth  o tangle    o penny    o my once-pretty  face      as a child             I was hairless  androgynous as a knife    no     as soap  as a child I licked        soap & watched  stubble ruin back up       from the part  of the skull             where our fur lives  already curled into          the shapes we  call boy the mirrors we tremor  through on our way out      of mothers  of fathers    half-sutured flags       I say  your name & finger the slip       of our  tongue           like a penny condemned  to a life of rust              I don’t believe  in boys   much less men      but if I did  they all would wear        their whiskers  as prettily as you boy means anything  that was once pretty        or tongueless  a single eyelash      shattering into gold  ( houndstooth,  dogwood,  rosewater )  I say your name in the mirror    & wait  for my father’s beard   to spider across  my face        then slide the razor home  through my skin     what is pretty in us  is what in us              is not our fathers  & whose flags we burn       back to ash  o tongue tangle      o cream bright rust  yes             come sing me back to sleep  tell me what use is my last    good face  if not buried    to the bone in flowers? The smell of rain forever lives in my memory, triggering home-  sickness through an endless river of aqueous nostalgia.  In the shower, I mask the scent of rain and wash away the muddy  trail of tears from my face. I struggle to grasp my mother’s  tongue, hanged over my shoulder as I wash my back. My trunk  extends far beyond my reach and the sun-dried silt never leaves  my skin. I call to my mother, but she does not hear and she struggles  to read my lips. Every word that I mouth looks like the Congo  and my accent sounds like the Nile. There’s an ocean between  our bodies and not a hyphen long enough to unite us. On each  strand of that ocean, lies my name and I live in between.

Skin like garnet, resinous, semi-precious. Decades after World War II ended, my mother eats rice with her fingers when there is no guest in the house. Some things begin out of necessity. Some things continue out of identity.  In 1991, I stepped out of the Chicago O’Hare airport. Saw heaps of snow for the first time. There are worlds made of ice. Now I am in one. If you stare into the depth of the garnet stone long enough, you could see a universe forming or dissolving. See how this ring fits my finger now.

Yemen in faded, homespun photos and Ratha’s kids  have been hungry, the market overrun, Abdul beaten and captured from his car. Yemen snicked my father’s heart –  the hole gushes because there are no more green fields and citrus trees, now it’s nothing and I’m from nowhere.  Yemen of heavy mocha and towering date palms, of panthers and tobacco shrubs. A Yemen of my great-aunts awake at sunrise  squatting around the outside oven, molding dough into fresh bread, scattering chicken bones to black vultures, stray cats,  the musk of woodsmoke and something growing. Yemen halved at its center and I with my head in my grandmother’s hands  as she braids my hair. I get no daily aid emails or fundraiser invites for Yemen. Nowhere on the news or in the thoughts of my friends  is Yemen spared a moment. I hear stories secondhand: from an uncle just returned, late in his arrival when the airport gets infiltrated,  from a static phone call in my mom’s kitchen, sobbing on the other end. I sit on our front porch, safe from seeing  their gaunt faces, far enough away from their sad smell as they wait, tired and drought-tongued, begging  for a small deliverance, for clean water, a Godly messenger, shade to rest in. This blonde girl          eyes green as St. Patrick’s day,  had the nerve to sit across from me   and the only other Black girl  in “The History of Reproduction and Contraception” in America.  and asks          body language spilling her disgust-  Why didn’t slaves just abstain from sex instead of birthing children into slavery?  and I’m just sitting there praying, like Sweeeeeeeeet Black Baby Jesus.  You gotta help me be a good Christian today.    That’s how we came to the talk of cotton root bark.  How a girl-slave would snatch some from the field,  gnash it between her teeth. Her attempt  to not have a child  by a master’s command to breed or midnight hunger  I wanna tell this green-eyed girl    I can’t even abstain from sex if I wanted to.  These men don’t care nothing  about no abstinence. They been in the business of take.  ain’t not one man thought about abstaining since  my hips spread           since my chest came to full bloom, but now    I’m the angry Black girl in class ready to raise hell  and kingdom come and send her to her maker  ‘cause she got violent with her words  now I’m supposed to sit there all silent.  while she curse those wombs that ain’t ask for it  and even if they did, had the right to hold some  joy inside  and then         she gon’ question our maternal instincts.    The maternal instinct would have been to not want your kids to go through that!    and I realize                oh.        She just don’t know  she just ain’t never had nothing taken from her.    I’m sitting in this class / with my black body / full of holes / an empty womb / I’m in this class/ and my body is so much history / so much the woman from the field in the hut/ and so much the man too / that I’m damn near crying at this point wondering / what do we got to abstain from? / I know / she ain’t never had nothing taken from her / but here I am / with my momma’s blood / trying to give to her / kindly / cast her bones / while mine break / salve her skin / while the graves between us / peel mine back / force my legs apart / staple my mouth shut-    My professor changes the subject without comment.  the blonde girl     eyes just as green as St. Patrick’s day  still looking at me and the only other Black girl in this class  Like she know             she ain’t got nothing  to lose. She bowed her head as if to lick the birth-slicked sloth bear while her keepers cheered from a closed-circuit television screen. Her lower lip scooped in the nursling and she cradled it between her tongue and the gap in her teeth before swallowing her own kin. Then she ate another, and her keepers gasped in horror. The world stalked the comments section, sunk its canines into her pelt, unhinged its jaw and swallowed her whole. The doctor said it was normal, that the babies were sick, spewed words like survival, carcass, resources  in the wild, but no one listened. Her keepers said  we can do better—- with gloved hands, they cupped the last bear cub like a harvested heart and raised it while Khali wasn’t looking.  She should have been watching that baby , said the woman wearing an oven mitt, fanning her cobbler. Pathological, said the neighbors, flicking off their porch lights, calling their children in from the wild. The summer before I went feral something was eating the chickens.  We’d wake in the night to their apocalyptic squawking  and knew some sacrificial mother was being eaten alive, but we said nothing  because we stayed up late every night fighting. I hated how my hands  reached for you while I slept, hated the maternal love I couldn’t shake  from them. They’d learned to forgive anyone who said they hated me.  Mornings we cradled our tired heads, pulled our bootlaces tight  and walked through the still-wet grass to count the chickens. The ones left  backed into their corners like baffled women. The only things left of the missing  were their crop-circled empty nests, their down— some stuck to the spurs and shanks of the living—  and their feet. Whatever ate them left their feet, which looked like cupped human hands.  What burns will burn, what’s left  is brick and the soot marring the brick—  what’s left is the rebuilding.    Become small as the seed, which waits  without speaking. Settle as the cicada does,  humming faintly in its dark bed of earth.    Count the pearls in the heirloom necklace,  each a grain of sand gilded by decades,  made in the murks under an ocean’s weight.    Practice moving your fingers through the air  so gently, you can hold a feather  without it touching your hand.    Stare at ice so long, it becomes the same  as water. Stare at water so long, it is gone.  Stare at the mark made after.    Parse apart the slung syllables of every book  until your tongue is nimble iron, then  teach your tongue the strength in silence.    Bridle your desire, halter and harness until  it stands at attention, taut as the rope  that leads to the bell that waits to be struck.    When you ring, ring loud, exactly when you need to,  bright note pitched as the phoenix hatches  and you burn and burn and burn and burn.        The shore greets impatiently, peeved it has taken so long.  Forgive me,  I whimper. It is true: I cowered before the coldness  of rifles, surrendered to the cruel apathy of their  bureaucracy. Here, at last, I look upon a sky free  of intrusive steel and glass. Boys with guttural names run  around and I do not watch over them. Instead, I cup  salt water and drench the ache off my face. After, we lay our shirts on the soft ground, bow as the sun sets. At night, I light after for Darwish and Kanafani.  We do not sing because the waves make our mouths futile. We  smoke till dawn and no one coughs. After, we walk, arms interlocked, straight towards an open horizon. No idiot tries  to stop us. To raconteur tongue, solar flare temper, Mom’s cheekbones, Pop’s weak eyes, to knuckle-busted hands, arachnid fingers, Bible names, terracotta curves, to plantations taken, vows broken, a potential future: green- legged and stalling until the surgeon’s saw, to musical ears, a fine reed of mouth, solitary mothers, separations, restraining orders, to holes: grandfather-shaped, and fathers who fantasized absence, plastic spoons, tall folks, to soldiers, sailors in violent jungles, roseless spring days, nights above melodic crack vial crunches, to Bed Stuy, gunshots beyond school fences, grandmother midwives, Ellis Island, to Atlantic graveyard, blackened sea floor, bad hearts, troubled brains to titles, never-ending christenings, mistakes both breathing and not, accepting blame, love under gaslight, child-shaped collateral, juvenile bulls-eye, to never ending right: a daughter, a poem. Spanish for Rich Port. The island’s official nickname is La isla del encanto (English: The island of enchantment ) and was described by the poet José Gautier Benítez as La perla de los mares (English: The pearl of the seas ). In “La Borinqueña” Columbus declares Esta es la linda tierra que busco yo (English: This is the beautiful land I seek ). 1   The Taíno name for the island was Borikén (English: The Land of the Valiant and Noble Lord ). The name survives today in Spanish as Borinquen. 2 History says the name Columbus gave the island was San Juan Bautista, after John the Baptist, 3 with the principal port being named Puerto Rico. Eventually sailors and traders switched the name of the port with the name of the island: San Juan became Puerto Rico; Puerto Rico became San Juan. 4   When Spain ceded the island to the US, the name was anglicized to Porto Rico, kept the name for 33 years. 5 Since 1952, the island’s official name is El Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico (English: The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 6 , lit. The Free Associated State of Puerto Rico) . 7  —   1 The Spanish came for oro. / When the rivers’ gold gave way / to sangre / they stayed / for sugar. Stayed / for slaves. / Plundered the island / in the name of empire. / The British invaded / and failed. / The US finally destroyed Spain’s empire / in the name of their own.    2 As always our fascination / with the native. / Our mythologizing. / The Noble Savage. / Kill the Taíno. /Say they put up / a good fight. / Hispanicize their names— / Borikén, Yuíza, Arasibo, Buinabo / : / Borinquen, Loíza, Arecibo, Guaynabo . / History books say the Taíno / were wiped out, / but even niggas who look like me / will claim the name. / Coño, even I’m guilty / of saying my father / has a Taíno nose.    3 The same story. / The Bible and the Sword. / I hang a rosario / from my door / for protection. / Make the sign of the cross / for good luck. / Recite the Our Father, / Hail Mary, / and Glory Be / on loop during takeoff / and landing / for all flights. / I understand the irony.    4 What’s a name / to a colonizer? / Columbus underestimated / the size of the globe. / Dubbed the Taínos / Indios . / Are you surprised / they couldn’t keep / the names straight? / Why even try when you’ve decided / the only names that matter / are the ones you give everything?    5 Which is to say / you stuffed the English language / into our throats / in the hopes / we’d regurgitate it / back at you. / The island shat it out instead. / My English makes me a traitor / even if Spanish / is still a colonial tongue. / The language of resistance / depends on the colonizer.    6 The name Commonwealth / does nothing to denote the island’s / colonial status. / Massachusetts is a Commonwealth. / Pennsylvania.

In this version there are no Jets or Sharks. There is no Tony or María. There are no upbeat dance numbers. This isn’t a feel-good story. The whole score is a slow bolero looped for 152 minutes. “America” is turned into a remix of “Lamento borincano,” the elegy it was always meant to be. The opening scene is a flight from San Juan to New York post-María (I guess there is a María in this movie). It contains the film’s only cameo: Rita Moreno stepping off the plane, looking back, fighting off tears, before she turns forward, disappears into a throng of bodies just like the rest of us. Benjamin Garcia  is my common name, but you can call me by my suborder:   Vermilingua , because my tongue worms into pockets. ¿Quieres   ver mi lengua? If you want to keep America America, better bolt it  down or lock it. Ahí vamos .  An anteater isn’t afraid of a cage, won’t hesitate to smite, transforms  its tropical depression to a migration  of wrath, machetes down its own path, though it contains  in its craw, a rainbow— un  arco iris .  If you choose, you can crawl away from this, if  you brunt the gridlock and contraflow  on I-45 North, along the evacuation route.  There is an out  though disaster is never complete. Without you,  the domestic animal left inside  the house might still survive.  Though you are embarrassed  by something smaller than a crushed ant, the shit-stains  of cockroaches, pocking the spine of your English  texts, the edges of your spiral-notebooks.  A tongue isn’t worth very much,  but there is enough for everyone. Remember: there is no cage;  you cannot leave; the joke: w hy do Mexicans wear pointy boots?   To get the roaches in the corners .  We all had German,  American, whatever kind of cockroach  shitting on our books, in our alarm clocks telling us to go the fuck  to school, where with difficulty,  I learned in drills  to kneel in single file along hard and polished halls  where the floor confronts the wall, then cover my ears  as the storm roared above. My class was promised  a piece of hard candy  to complete this analogy: tire : hubcap :: hurricane : _______. You   keep those grades up, one day you’re going to make so much money.  So why do Mexicans wear pointy boots? I didn’t  delouse my tongue, because even then,  I knew. Nothing comes quickly but disaster. I would have to make myself  fat on what others might be made sick by. But where is your family   really from? What’s your native tongue?  I ate it—       Morning opens like a sore  in Silver City, where men  gut their own mother’s  belly—not for precious metals    but truck-loads of gravel  for driveways, foundations,  xeriscaped yards trying  so hard to look like they are    self-sufficient. The sun  overtakes the sky, like pain  evaporates the mind and  its little headlamp. A riddle:    what can be divided like a worm,  squirms, welcomes itself into one  body, is alive three times, you  would exchange a ton of gold    for any measure of it if you only knew  it was leaving. I bet you got it  by now, I bet you guessed water.  You’d be right. But I wasn’t    thinking water. I thought God,  or universe. Not that I’m wrong  or right to think this way,  because perception is on that list,    too. It fractures and isn’t broken.  My neighbor in his 70’s trailer  has about ten dogs, and those dogs  are believers, too, followers of the cult    of the Virgin of Pain. Their master  punishes them with a baseball bat for shitting  in the fenced-in yard. The bat is the metal kind  that rings across the exposed rock    as it strikes them across the back.  And the dogs don’t break, neither  does the bat. They are the kindest dogs,  they fear their own bodies, bringers    of pain, because they know their bodies  are imperfect, defecate  when they meant to pray/fetch/  bone. It’s hard to know what wise men    know. No, what wise men want  with such a limited brain. I wake to work  in the mines, well, to move  the gravel around, that’s all I do all day.    It’s what my father did, it’s what my sons will do  unless they leave. We got rid of the old  trucks, the kind that dump by lifting back  in one huge pile. Now the truck bed    opens up in flaps like an autopsy,  disembowels itself. It’s easy enough.  Still, I’ll wake up grating  my teeth. There are more shards of meth    in Hurley than there are stars in the sky.  But maybe we could all be good  if we could learn to be afraid  of our own assholes. Sometimes    when I wake, I could swear  someone was there. God, my mind  leaps up—and I’m like a dog  jerked awake by its own fart.    Each morning, I wake up grateful.  Each morning, I forget to remember  to call the dog pound. When I tell Marcelino,   I swear to God,  one of these days     I’m gunna do it, he only says: good for you.  And day makes a fist, and parts  of Silver City spill into the far away suburbs:  Santa Fe—Phoenix—Albuquerque. most days / I imagine my death  in color /or as an itchy ache    tangible as the calamus  of goosefeather needling through    the fabric of the blanket  on my bed / discomfort taking    the place of warmth / for example  the dream of my death is a study    in red / where I am young  and my mother is always there    insistent as the sunrise / and alive  by which I mean / her existence    in that dream is the reason  I have never been able    to believe / I will grow old  the most natural thing in life    I’m told / is a child will bury  her parents / not the other way    around /so it must be that I am not  as god intended / my wants unnatural    and crude / for example I didn’t love  that blanket til it hurt me    but after that I couldn’t sleep  without the ache / for example    I didn’t know I feared my mother  until I realized / she would age     *This poem borrows its title from an episode of the TV show, Supernatural. Death– how I keep coughing up more of myself into you, drop a liver haphazardly into your arms. I’ve begun to forget this is an exchange– I hand you my body for what? Another year closer to ghost? I spent the last six months believing in you, believed that if I prayed enough you’d finally let me out of your cradle. After the hospital: everything I drink starts to taste like hand sanitizer, meaning perhaps I am cleaning my hands towards  alive . Or, another bottled thought, acetonic wish that eventually becomes decay. Hospital visitors unravel their undefective limbs, swinging them like a lottery prize. My arms: rotating vials. The lottery prize: a body not half dead. The first boy I loved had river eyes and two kidneys, and hiding from my own skeletal frame, I propelled myself towards him. Love became a gamble of tongues, of bones trading joints. I wanted to steal his lungs. I hid under his healthy ribs. In my dreams I have a whole body, but I am always still looking for something. I suppose I will forever be fractional. Yesterday a woman visited with a pastry box and a mouthful of get wells , brought her children who later named me shadow. I peeled off the top of the pie– hesitant, waiting, ready to find something dead beneath the crust. I’ve never told you how my father tied a drunk man to a chair  and snapped the first four fingers on his left hand.  How the moon, a sickle soaked in milk, hung center the window cracked from frantic birds  and how the man, his dad, howled like a stray in the hills the boys’ bragged of maiming.  You might be wondering what happened to the fifth finger his thumb  and whether it stayed straight or faced a similar form of fracture.  But none of that matters.  In the time it’d take to detail a thumb pried loose, I  could move from the shed to the house a quarter mile north,  where my nana swirls salt in soup  and sways her hips to Elvis, John Prine.  How can she dance when the dead crawl inside?  How can she dance with a body branded, owned by a beast, a belt that blooms the tremors?  Believe when I tell you the fifth was spared.  That my father ran out of whisky out of spite,  stopped soothing with blood sought light  and stepped out deeply hidden, an animal crazed for water.  That he found in his search an oasis,  and there lapped stars until shame clotted concealed  spread like yeast through his heart.  Sometimes that’s all that it takes. One taste. One. For deadwind  to enter and eat the insides  of a boy of a boy of a boy of a boy of a boy of a boy of a boy—  i. A knuckle pops in my throat the moment a student, an 18 year old, asks me,  maestro, would you take a bullet for me? and my classroom is an empty house as the words leave his mouth. My solar plexus caves. I say  mijo, I decided that the moment I bubbled in the first multiple-choice question in my certification exam, eighteen years ago. I’ve been waiting for you to ask this question.  I hope I pass this test.  ii. Mr. Mendez has a class of 35 students in a temporary building facing the playground. The entrance to the playground is at the far corner. A man in a pea coat enters at the corner with a gun. An announcement breaks over the loud speaker “Mr. Red is in the building.”  What should Mr. Mendez do?  A) tell all the children to hold their breaths, think of air, of floating around in the sunlight. B) tell the kids to count the number of times they hear a footstep, a click, a bang, a body. C) tell them: freeze, exactly as you are, grip this poem, a pulse crossing your temples. D) turn out the lights, hide the children in the books they picked up that last library visit.  iii. And someone says,     “give the teachers guns” I stumble and shatter into slivers of voice box and wails. Mi salon es una casa. Do you want us to speak into an empty house?  iv. When time comes, I will put all you students in my pockets. when one doesn’t fit, I will stitch another pocket on,            this one, dead center on my heart, and hope that if that’s the one                  that aims at me, this is where we will be,     that I’m taken as I am.   The gun I want is in the shape of a book, its pages, the only shell casings I need covering my floor. When I yelled fire she was stoned and watching TV. Our steaks, our oven, some foil had touched the element and lit in long flames like yellow trees waving up through the greasy rack. It was over, I was dead, I’d burned our world. She walked to the kitchen, twisted the top off the salt, dumped a pile of white on my disaster. Extinguished in a moment, no smoke, no word. Then back to Three’s Company and the scratch of her Zippo while she lit a Marlboro.   II My co-worker’s doing this wrong. I want to tell her what my sister told me: To sell that sick day, you have to throw in one more. No one believes you’re sick if you’re only gone a day. Maybe they know you’re lying, but two days has the tickle of the truth. Maybe you almost died. Maybe you’re brave to come back from that hell of blood or puking or crackers. Maybe you secretly had surgery, a D&C and you’ve been sleeping off guilt and anesthesia. Make them think you have a secret and it’s not good.   III My sister said take half the drug. Whatever they give you, take half. Doesn’t matter what—acid, KJ, Darvon, speed. Tear it, break it, go in the bathroom and empty half of the capsule into another. Then put one half in your pocket. That way if you don’t get high enough there’s more, and if the guy you’re with has laced it, you’ll only be half as stupid and twice as mad. My sister has never OD’d. Her best friend did, a beautiful angel who hovers over my sister every minute, every night, every dream, every reading of tarot or palms or Ouija. We play those ghostly games and laugh, but I know she’s really listening for a voice, looking for her friend’s long cascade of hair. She’s asking every day, every drink, every time she looks out the window at the back of the 7-Eleven she’s thinking why in hell did you leave me, where did you go? Tell me again about the bloodhound that chases you  into lark black sky.  Dar es Salaam in the 70s is the heart of a Nandi flame  shrouded by the woodland smoke of your silence.   I’m sorry. I know this story bleeds and the scent  of it stirs awake the meteoric dark— the haul  of carrying violence from one generation to another.  Tell me again about the wound that is my wound,  the blood that crossed an ocean to become the beads  of the tasbih I hold in my hands.  Tell me again about the first slur you heard,  English snapping at heels still yoked to another country,  and how kutchi vanished like wild deer into the ash.  I tear apart my body for an answer to where I began.  I am a beast subdued only by your voice.  So tell me again about the faces that fled the wind  and I will apologise. I’ll be the swallow gliding through August sky that shits on his ugly head, the splintered  glass he cuts his toes on, the thing with needle teeth and too many legs  he feels crawling on his neck but can’t see. I want disembodied hands to slap his ass  at the supermarket while he sniffs cantaloupe, peaches that hiss I’d fuck you, sweetheart  when he fingers their skin. Give me his dignity. Fill his family portraits  with my bare breasts, paper his walls with my open thighs, my oil-greased  lips. Carve my eyes into his wood floor. Let him wake to the fullness  of my hips smothering him, drown him in the wetness he wanted to touch.        Natalie Portman teaches me how to touch myself. Her body writhing in the bathtub, hips arcing up out of the big screen: an offering. For years, I will only rub over the lace of my panties, the warmdark of me too intimate even for my own fingers.  I was perfect , she says breathily, in the final act, blood blooming against the white of her feathered bodice. Another girlish corpse hurtling deathward. At church, I pray for god to make me clean and count the minutes until I can shroud myself in bedsheet & dance into the sweat-ringed arms of sleep. The last & only person to see my budding body naked took a scalpel to it (and how am I to know, years later, a lover will use the scar as a road map? Lick the salt from its seam?). Pleasure, for me, has always come pricked with the embroidery of shame. I take my right hand and deliver myself	from evil into the sleek ‘S’ of a swan. This myth doesn’t end how you think it will. Not in flight         not in birth        but in song. The patio at this bar births brown ladybugs  & I’m burning my mouth for fun. On the edges    of desi women’s lips : milk souring, some liquor    to help us forget. Cities in America & I  am tired. Villages back home—I squint    & almost belong—& train cars rattle, peopled,    my god, limbs everywhere. Call this day scant & hear  the letters wrong. Call me foreign    & god have I complied. Women I’d call sister,    I see you. There’s soot coating rails & the heat  is our house & I can’t rid this book    of my life, & we’re all coins left in fountains    making language of strife. Alina’s name is a song  & she knows it, & I’m veering political    over cardamom at the bar, I gesture with my hands    & it is universal, I ask : what are we stained by  if not our love of men?    Where do we go at sunset? Who sees us    on the ground in the dark, clouds of dust  in our wake, shuffling to or from ourselves? My mouth    is on fire & I light the thing backwards    & Alina says today is the day of three-hundred hugs  just between us. She’s got a bottle    in her hand & the posture    of an immigrant & I won’t rid this book  of our lives. This poem is about    recognition. This poem is about wishful    thinking. Women, I want it to be  believable : that we leave the bar, the sky stupid    with gold. That no one follows us home. Carri ón de los Condes to Terradillos de los Templarios, Castilla y Leó n, Spain, Way of St. James    Sisters, after the day’s long walk, how fresh you were,  your white habits belted with a woven cord,  your hair covered in white wraps. So young you seemed,    to have taken vows of chastity. When I was a child,  my father brought me to meet  my cloistered great aunt, her skin the color of twilight    behind the screen where they kept her, or so it seemed,  like a prisoner. But you sang Eres t ú and strummed  your guitars as if in love with each one of us.    When you sat us in a circle and asked us to share  why we are on the Way–I said I wanted to escape,  but didn’t say from what. One of the pilgrims, a man,    told me, Eres una gran mujer, You ’re a good woman .  But it’s a sham, a game I play, this act of goodness.  When I was seventeen and my hair was black and long,    my boyfriend, too old for me, knocked me up–  such a crude expression, forgive me.  My mother discovered the abortion months later–    she had glanced at my bank withdrawals. I didn’t lie,  as my boyfriend said I should’ve, and tell her I’d bought new clothes.  God will never forgive you , my father swore.    The guidebook says in Carrión de los Condes, when el Cid’s  two married daughters were stripped of their robes  and jewels, tied to a tree and beaten, their father the count    galloped on his epic horse to free them, then married them off  to some other lord, still chattel, but honor restored.  These stories are old, but if I had told you mine in Carrión,    I suspect I’d have shocked you. Carrion, la carro ñ a , decaying flesh.  Dear Sisters, I want to escape this invisible body,  call it a sheath of shame, to leave it on the hot, dry road for the vultures.           Picked clean as a bleached sheet, a pony skull  nested in the grass on the side of the path,  eyes dull. On hill slopes, the ponies prance  and bleat, unaware they are alive only to be killed–  Viand e de cheval , a common dish in this village.  In the monastery at Roncesvalles a row of skulls  arcs under a spotlight, bones of pilgrims  discovered in catacombs beneath the stone chapel,  an ancient hospital, as in hostel , or hospice ,  a medieval clinic for bread and wine, respite  from vagaries of torrential rains, mud, late May snows.  At vespers, my new friend and I enter the church  with the others for the pilgrim’s blessing.  Two days ago, a man died of a heart attack  on the way down the valley–you never know.  Kerry’s strong from hiking the Himalayas  and the Pacific Crest. She tells me not to look  at the anti-abortion pamphlets with photos  of blurry fetuses on vestibule tables.  She tells me her wife is a rogue priest,  ordained in secret by three bishops who risked  excommunication. The basilica blazes  with tall white candles, armfuls of lilies,  carved effigies of saints lacquered in gold leaf.  Three priests in white gowns reach their arms  toward vaulted ceilings like bodily conduits of God,  amanuenses of the divine. They burn incense  and chime bells to conjure archangels.  They summon the holy ghost, pour it  into a gold chalice, and gulp. Above the priests  floats a gilded statue of Mary, Mother of God.  She is too innocent for me, untouched  as she was, or I am too sullied for her.  I need a blessing, but need is not quite belief .          Christine Swint's first poetry collection is Swimming This (2015) with FutureCycle Press. A former high school Spanish instructor, she teaches English part time at Kennesaw State University and writes about pilgrimage, spirituality, and poetry at Balanced on the Edge,  https://balancedonedge.blog. She holds degrees in English and Spanish from the University of Georgia, a master's in Spanish from Middlebury College, and an M.F.A. in creative writing from Georgia State University. Her current project is a travelogue in verse that chronicles a 500-mile pilgrimage she took from the Pyrenees Mountains in France to Santiago de Compostela, Spain, ending in Fisterra, in the region of Galicia. I keep reliving her own World War Two traumas. In which the name of a popular band references the prostitution sector of a Nazi camp, and the singer commits suicide before their first American tour. Joy Division, indeed. In which the writer of a book with a child of her own writes about the way the Japanese made hookers of children and conducted live experiments on the childless that they made child-less, & she is harassed night after night after night for months & years until people with something to hide have remade her ears & her eyes into another site of atrocity & she takes her own life & while the funeral is held in Cupertino, across the world a memorial for victims of the massacre make for her, a statue and a cupid’s wing. Her child is two. When I show my class a picture of Frida, a student yells Oh Shit.   Instantly, I’m on the defensive:    Can yours roar?  When furrowed,  are your brows birds?  Each unplucked hair  boats across oceans,  home – azul like nothing in nature  yet rooted in revolution’s bullets  over clothing lines, burrowing  holes in white linens and the busted bus  that burrowed holes in bone,  rods that held her together,  back brace that broke her heart.  Her brows, the only body part  not saturated in tragedy like gangrene –  hungry, ravenous even.  How it swallowed her feet whole,  smacked its lips, choking down each toe.  Kid, what do you know  of lust and love that lives  through miscarriages,  that outlasts body parts?  What do any of us know of  tending to that unhealable wound?  I was lucky, I birthed a son  who bares her name,  and if I raise him right,  her spirit too in each hair  of his tiny brows like her brows,  which I praise when my husband,  the same man who held my hand  though the blood and horrorshow of birth,  jumps his hand away from my unshaved leg  like its prickles are fire,  like the hair will swallow him whole.  How thankful I am, to her brows,  for giving me the strength to say  I’ll shave mine when you shave yours  without apology for being woman.  Oh holy conjoined black bears,  unplucked iconoclasts  that drink to swim, not drown.  Holy untweezed revealers  of a woman’s multitudes-  flowers that bloom  from a dying head.    When I show my class a picture of Frida,  a student yells Oh Shit,  Then, takes a photo with his phone.  She’s gonna be my background. I know one thing for sure: I am not having any fun.  I do not know who to call when 5 AM thunderstorms.  I do not know how arms became children of themselves      aching  to grasp. My friends are all out drinking now and I am begging  a stone       to leave or burst into photographs. The present  is just an unripe past and we throw our hands for sugar.  Nobody told me. That love is the dead stars still heaving  the sky on, is daisies pressed between the words: the crushed  flower skeletons decorating a note on the fridge.  She will tell you that teeth will turn to crumbs in the sun  and chatter in the snow and stones will always carry a knife  so never abandon your thirst for staying alive. The echo  and all your tender lovers will forget. There is no meal  on the other side of staying strong.       Only a glint  in the hunter’s eye before he mouths your name. If a new life begins after each blackout, all the ghosts in this house would have to wake from their slumbers. the last man steps out of the Makabarta and it seems like learning jazz again. each time we walk into the boneyard with stereos muffled in our stomachs. the path of dust in between the graves        lead to another freshly dug hole, a space for a new beginning. cairns erected over new heaps of brown soil, only few had epitaphs,        I assume none of their lovers found a tongue        to fill the cabinets with a song         that’ll round off the edges of their emptiness. This, like the night           when thunder unbuttoned the sky, to give space for the wandering shadows, I feel my bones reverse to be tendons again. on the grave marker, I see names that sound too close to mine and dates as close           as the day before. a piece of her bedsheet was wrapped around her marker as if to remind us all that           only the living should crave warmth, because the sky has never been closer no matter how high we jump. Here, the gates are opened for goats to wander and graze upon all that grows for staying long beneath the ground.  I see taro leaves           sprouting from the plain ground, waiting to be dug. the last man steps out of the Makabarta, this time,          he looks behind – a bird perched on the new marker. how long until another will be planted How long does any part of the graveyard      remain plain until it becomes a new country? Set two, two plates instead of three: you will not be returning. In your small shoes, your small coat with the smaller buttons, you have never looked so full of faith, mouthing the words Moriah, mother. Mother . I will not call you child but sacrifice, sacrament , animal. When you hug me, my heart conks out: stunning in non-ritual slaughter, blood slick like a botched birth.  This is my own faith at its finest: bestial benediction, my knees rubbed red, filthy from so much kneeling. And my hair: a scorching halo. Abraham tells me this test is God’s gift. I etch every answer ‘til the paper splits like a lip: a.) I have never been more certain b.) I have never been more certain c.) I have never been more certain         Antonovsky suggests, as Freud did, that psychological illness is born of narrative incoherence, a life story veering off course. —RACHEL AVIV, The New Yorker , April 2017   One time I spent the whole session balloon-lettering FUCK YOU onto a yellow legal pad. I had been mum for weeks, and the men in the room were rapt. She’s writing us a message , one said. And boy, was I ever. The dust motes haloed my head while I scrawled my holy writ. Another time Mama slipped a tape recorder into my pocket. It’s not fair she said, showing me how to use it, two big men ganging up on a little girl. I had, of course, used it before to record the dumb story of my young life. I could feel it in my pocket during those long weeks, heavy as Daddy’s big textbooks. At night I’d creep from bed and scan the words for broken: aphasia, agnosia, amnesia . Afterwards she’d listen to every word, cluck her tongue, and wind the tape back up into a waiting asp. These were the days when I still knew every part of the story. They met, they had me, we were we. One time I spent the whole session with my eyes closed. I saw dangerous weather-map hues though my hands weren’t pressing my lids. I never knew whether I was well or ill, dreamed of being bedridden like Beth, Jo helping her die in that novel. We were not sick but simple, believed there were still threads tying us, still more rungs on a ladder that would lift us. The last time I ran from the musty office and leapt on the hood of his Yukon. I clambered to its pollen-dusted roof and sat there, took root like a lotus: my tendrils searching the depths. I had no plan other than make it stop . Those two big men stood there dumbstruck, in awe of me. I think she’s trying to make a statement , one said. She looks like a martyr, said the other. One of those men was a doctor. One of those men was my father. Once I read about Nazi Germany and how glamorous actresses with pencil thin brows dipped white rose petals in ether and chloroform and sucked them dry for breakfast while their country burned.     Once I wrote a story where hair was braided so tight, it pulled the scalp away from the body.     Once I saw a girl dragged under a trailer by her feet; we were in second grade and at school and to this day when I climb an open stairwell in the dark I race from what might be lurking, even in my locked house, even though the sun was shining that day.     Something I have never been is a runner.     Once nine-year-old me scrambled away from a voice in the dark opened doorway of a van that called,  “hey, little girl”     Once thirteen-year-old me scrambled up a fence as an unknown van veered off the road, towards me,  and wouldn’t stop,  I tumbled,  and it kept coming  I ripped the flesh off my own hands  and it kept coming  danger bubbled in my gut, stung my chapped lips  and it kept coming,  but it wasn’t danger.  It was my mother, in a different car, and she was laughing.     Once fourteen-year-old me was a zoo animal, caged with other zoo animals, watching a weary zookeeper nod at our wildness and blink back the sun.     Something I have always feared is dying without an audience.     Once I heard about three sisters in a field, and a boy took the first home, then the second. The last sister was sad and crying, so the boy took her home too; and all three made themselves useful to him, and lived long happy lives.     Once I sold a poem about how well I scurry and climb. How honorable all the scurrying! How noble my bloody hands!     Once I told a lie about Icarus and his feathers. Every boy is Icarus, and every girl a ball of wax. I wonder what our mothers think, watching us plummet; I wonder if they ever dreamed about the ocean floor.     During daylight. When toddlers nap, mothers take their siestas, men smoke cigarettes after too-heavy lunches. One of many, I am, one of many beings gazing unblinking into the distance.  I hold my breath until my vision goes white, my skin prickles. For the sake of breathing, little lungs lined up on cots, small snores and the orbit of motherhood. How round  can I become, spread like the Vitruvian Man and plump, ripe as a mango peeled by lamplight. I am looking for a way to die that does not make use of fire or water That does not make headline of my country ablaze or my children in sinking boats My people’s blood is famous for its quiet How it can exist in our veins and in our streets And elicit no response either way I am 22 now and always crying On my walk home, I watch an animal on the road fur flattened by traffic and it moves me to tears This is not what I wanted when I prayed to become softer What I want to say is: this world hurts me to extents unbearable And the balm of love Of my head in a man’s lap Is a torn photograph is a backwards glance I am reaching for something that does not exist This world hurts me Lights my city on fire Makes nostalgia of where the minarets once stood I write down the better times so I do not forget I take pictures of every unbroken thing Before a father built gas masks out of plastic cups Before our air became rationed by Sarin Before prayers became a bargain with God I map the concept of a nation without teeth Of an ocean too kind to swallow bodies I am reaching for something that does not exist. Over on the other side of the world, my māma’s home / is lonely, full of love. Her voice on the other end of the phone / low as a dip in the cold, basin below the earth, low / like bass, like the murmur in my chest, and shy, and faint, / footfall on clock-ice. Wéi? Māma // is low as the moon, as space. I am praying for the stars to shine / beside her smile, which currently sits cautious curled up precarious atop / her reading glasses and mainly in the dark. Wéi? // Wéi, nǐ tīng dé jiàn wǒ ma? Are you there? À. Her voice low // as the blues, the shakier moments of the day, as jelly legs, / as hands pressed to my stomach. Ng. She softens // for her mother, because lăo lao has ears / and a seventy-five-year-old heart we dare not strum. Māma, / are you okay? Wéi? What’s in a whisper / I can’t hear? The crackle of the phone vast. It’s as if / there are tens of thousands of / elbows jostling between us. // I stay reaching. Wéi, nǐ tīng dé jiàn wǒ ma? Where are your / brothers and your sisters? Lăo lao has ears / and a mouth they don’t like to / soothe or tiptoe around, and a heart, spooked, / full of love. You dare not strum, but you summon every / string in your body and place them gently in her hands. Māma, // I love you.  Wéi? Take care. What spooks a heart? Memory. / And aliens. Fighting a cosmic battle. And there amid brushstroke and mountain rock, thick stone masks in family portrait at nondescript restaurant / you send over WeChat. Guān Yīn, did you know/ my māma’s home is singing the blues / in Mandarin, and sanded skin, and she doesn’t know / what to do with all the love / blaring from the TV screen, and lăo lao has ears / and a flare-up heart, thundering, to the rescue, / and our salvation, and / she says she will have wings, // her voice shrill, well-meaning, superhero, invasion, fuming, / smoking out my māma’s voice? Lonely // ache together. Three plus / generations. And tens of thousands of elbows. Where are our / brothers and our sisters? The crackle of the phone vast. I am praying for the stars to shine. // Over on the other side of the world, my māma / is low as the moon, as space, filling my head. It was a nightmare in which disembodied girls spoke in imaginary voices. They said, “It is winter everywhere inside you,” then disappeared into the starcharts.  When the nurse took my pulse, she gave me a vial of ether and a vial of honey then adjusted the roots of my gown.  I said neocortex then stroked the pony.  Shivering girls with cutting disorders were transfigured into kings. We held a vigil for rust, a vigil for rocks and a vigil for vegetables.  When I scattered my clothes on the roof of the stable, I smashed the honey vial and one thousand landscapes of bees swarmed above me.  When I smashed the vile of ether, I was resurrected into a landscape of animal tracks and goose feathers. Live moths were stitched into my crown.  Either I collapsed to the floor of my inner visions, or I was reciting the names of birds. I said, my scars are a cemetery of self abuse or else they are the ghosts of past hospitalizations.  When I was performing my most daring knife trick, a blade of jasmine formed a sequin of blood. Then I’d wake up screaming of the violence of kitchens and vomiting between the snow.  Now, when I can’t sleep, I count myself with the stars. Or I move among the stables saying i can see every miracle. Then I lie still until my animal body forms.  River woke up with their name on the whiteboard  a crucifix on the wall their parents straight from new mexico  we talk of poems of estrogen, who sent the flowers  when the nurse asks me to shave their beard, I do  when the nurse slips a she in my direction  I don’t correct him River does, despite the difficulty of speaking  I wish we woke up in a different world but we’re here  together holding hands in intensive care. name a mistake & i’ll tell you if i’ve made it / they were all so beautiful i could write a song or paint a mural / or cross stitch them into the world’s largest & most uncomfortable pillow / & i will give you that pillow because i am a taurus / & you deserve everything.   i don’t know how time zones work or why they hurt / i rarely answer the phone / instead i make lists— / ugly hawaiian shirt / turbulence / old man coughing loudly / sometimes i adjust my glasses when they aren’t there.   if this plane dove i wouldn’t pay attention to whose face i saw first / instead i’d hear every color & feel every sound at once / remember any trans person who has smiled / & every scratch my cat left on me / & i know the ocean will grow hands to hold me—   cold & safe like my mother’s when i reached / across my brother to hold them as she cried in the back of a cab / the ocean will grow hands to hold me & i still have trouble sleeping / since i realized that any picture i take of water is different / the ocean / grew hands to hold me the last time i saw my grandfather & when i say last time   i mean remember when he held me with everything he had left in him like the ocean? the woman in the room across from his was yelling hadi gel , come on now come on to no one in particular over & over until the birds started to repeat her.   he was all bone & fake teeth & i could’ve sworn i felt something between us like a wave of relief.      I do not let my mother read my poems because they are about love. I do not let my mother hear my voice when I am in love. I do not let my mother love me. I do not think my mother loves me. I do not think my mother knows how to love anymore. I do not think my mother gives enough love to my father. I do not think my father would leave the woman he loves. I do  not  think  my  father  understands  the  woman  he  loves.  I  do  not  think  my  father understands  that  I  am  not  a  woman.  I  do  not  think  my  father  understands  that  I  love  a woman.  I  do  not  think  my  father  and  the  woman  I  love  and  my  mother  understand  that there is something else going on when I don’t want to be anybody’s friend, or when I forget the  grocery  list  every  time,  or  when  I  miss  their  phone  calls  even  when  I  am  waiting  for them. I listen to pop music because I’m tired of being sad. I unintentionally match outfits with my trans therapist.  When I am angry I think in Turkish. I read poems by trans people to feel better.  I’m afraid of paradise. I think about how people can die of an enlarged heart.  I’m realizing that I’m obsessed with moving forward. I want to make sure I have enough time.  I imagine liberation for everyone who needs it & consequences for those who prevent it.  I look at the sun setting over the lake to push out the moon & think of moonmoons  because who wouldn’t want a small moon orbiting around them constantly?  I search for jobs that don’t cause me pain. I remember that I am good enough.  I hold one handle of the shopping bag & my brother grabs the other to help me.  We walk to share the burden of the weight.        The wound was obvious once he pointed it out – the light was a symptom of dying.  I should have known this, having grown up in the glare of a great absence.  He gestured me to come and stand with him, to look up into the canopy,  pointed out the thinning, the blue gaping pieces of sky.  The arborist explained when a maple is well there are no breaks in its shadow.  I saw the shade in my childhood sliced through with light.  I used to walk my cousin two miles to school each morning,  and make up stories about the trees, tell her their names, their intentions.  The arborist showed me how the roots of the maple were so blocked  by pipes and pavement that they had circled around their own trunk  and through its twining thirst the tree was slowly strangling.  I wonder if all suicides begin like this, with something unquenchable.  I see now why the crimson poppies have been spreading with such force  shouting their fragile exuberance into our yard’s new light. When the right kind of man came along, I woke in a room stacked with waiting plates, my very own spoons.  The day broke warm on the outskirts of winter. I bathed, dressed early, cinched my grandmother’s gold on my neck.  Pictures, my brothers laughing. Someone said, You should eat. Someone said, I will make you a trail of ashes. Me?  Later he’d say he went for breakfast, felt sick, got caught on the far side of town by the train. The quiet song  of the front door hinge caused my heart to break. Bare-armed, I waited, one last borrowed room  bundled with flowers and chairs. The organ began, optimistic. Later I’d say, Let me tell you a dream I had:  the naïve light of morning, my dad’s warm arm, that red aisle, tether and bridge. A line of fine men  on the altar, him first and hiding a smile. Later we’d say something showed us the way  in the moonlight, that we walked all night. The wind had scattered the ashes.  A house standing all by itself. I wandered from one room to the next.  And here is the finger with the ring still on it. the doctor says my mother is suffering from retrograde amnesia & it will take long if not eight years or more for her to kiss the nape of any hunger. i press my hands against her body & listen to the war on television. a child’s love is butter & milk, two thirds worry & two thirds grief. i want to believe in rebirth that what comes from loss is a form of fibrous light partitioned into many rays. my mother is a poem liable to come apart if touched without a heart. can i give her today since she has lost hold of yesterday? what is memory if not the proper noun for a woman caught stealing into her own body. i give my mother a new day & a spark, tell her to sift through boxes of photos & old videos & be ready to weave the welkin sphere of a body still empty with another inside. it’s uncanny how much she no longer cares about her fish flick pond. she talks to herself like a witness—the stillness of moths on a vase of tulips—the shame of birds without seed. a book lies nearby in a room filled with dust that light brings. picture this: think of a keyboard in a forgotten earth in August where someone presses the delete button. & when i thought about the petals of a dead magnolia blossom. i knew I wanted them to mean nothing & suggest everything— that we must make meaning to survive. how it feels to stand outside a house falling off this umber world. i look at my mother & see a door— where things go to lose their names. either way history does not end in borders. & i understand when people say you don’t miss what you don’t know, they mean there is no environmentally safe way to remember. Some Sunday, you’ll be
eating slices of toast,  maybe an orange, your
face sticky,  happy with honey on a
back porch  when something will peel
back—  the scent of burnt
leaves,  that cold you find
toward the end  of September beneath
layers of heat.  You’ll notice crumbs
floating  in your coffee mug, a
dog hair  in the sunlit honey pot.  Know that it’s ok, then,
to think of her  years ago, sitting on a
papered table  in a doctor’s office,
her fingers  tracing the scar on her
chest  as she slowly unbuttoned
her shirt. I was trapped at a dinner party / full of white people / who ate hors d’ oeuvres / they arranged with / military precision / on white china / and over the white china / there was a swarm of bees / “We have a hive” said the Hostess / I thought about how / the bees avoided the people / But the Hostess laughed / and shooed them away / and didn’t see the / bees that lingered / And the nice, white people / didn’t mention Charlottesville / They talked about the New York Times / They ate soggy carnitas / They talked about Africa / without talking about / Her people / They ignored / the Black people / the bees / that lingered still / I poured more sangria / The Hostess said, “Your hair is pretty,” She didn’t know she meant / exotic / That I had cut my dreads that morning / Cut the curls that clung together / The sangria was colored like blood / I was sorry to cut the curls apart / I ate the crunchy rice / while they talked about Obama / The Hostess lit torches to / rid the porch of bees / with smoke / Last night white men swarmed / with torches to ward off the Black people / I was sorry for the bees.     Swirling
rows of budding wheat, and the mist settles upward:  a
lone tractor paves patterns in the land, air taupe and hazy.   Tractor
boy drives with poetic calm, raking hay as if in meter.  Bandana
trailing from a pocket, he steers, wrist   flung
over a hoopy wheel. Barn swallows in jittering waves  carve
out figure eights in his wake. Years pass away   and
now his daughter mows neighbors’ teeming yards.  In
shorts cut at the knees, hat turned back, solitary   as
a monk furrowing the labyrinth, she patterns her paces  to
the hum of a Walkman, looping beneath the roar.   When
the engine stalls to silence, the rip-cord converted  to
prayer wheel turns over, catches in her curses.   She
tries to shake the image from her mind: a neighbor  caught
in his prairie fire, controlled burn become immolation.   When
the engine fires up, she traces again the contours  of
the land, churning small town grass into lumpy rows,   staining
high tops green. She stops to listen as augur birds  chatter
idly overhead, turning, engine-like, into themselves. Today
is for changing itineraries and guilty smiles. Rubbing puppies’ bellies and
swapping glances with the guy scooping ice cream like “Come on, man. I asked
for a large.” Gamblers’ tells all. Young buck at the edge of the woods looking
for a fight as I head out for a run in morning fog heavy with almost-November
chill. The first half-mile a little less-limpy than usual. And then understanding
like a watermelon dropped out a 3 rd floor dorm window bouncing into
the basket of a passing bicyclist who pedals away whistling “My Country ‘Tis of
Thee.” Bonbons sticky with extra icing. Extra bitter coffee. The world is
softening butter. A gentle rain thru a pinkening sky. My hands in a book I’ve
never read but one that I’ve always wanted to. A book I didn’t know I owned. The
story of a boy walking home from school unsure of whether or not his parents
will be there when he arrives. With every step, sections of the sidewalk become
ice cubes floating in a frat party punch bowl. Somehow he manages to leap from
one to another to another, his backpack bouncing up and down off his spine. The
air fills with the stench of pissing diesel engines like toddler hands sticky
with 100% not-juice drink. A line-up of bird silhouettes along a telephone wire
desperate to look like they’re not looking. It’s all kind of cute. It’s not
cute at all. Down an alley to the right, a couple of matching blue suits
playing hopscotch. A third juggles four, no, five limes. He’s lost his grocery
list! He’s taking bets, oh! Look at him. 
By the pool the vultures circled and perched
on the roof to watch his naked
body rock  over mine. Danger is never as
interesting as the possibility  of danger. As if wanting me were a song he
hummed without knowing, I
listened  with eyes closed and waited for the pattern to
break. The chachalaca sang  like scrap metal dragged across more scrap
metal. We lay all day like
fruit  burst open for the birds to take and awoke at night to
a crashing outside our room,  which was not a break-in but the crude drum of the mangos falling  in the garden out of their ripe
skins. No pomp, just
bruising. All I’m Saying Is   No
one is better at cracking open a steamed lobster  than
my dad is     the shell split along all
the right lines  The
lobster is heavier than it looks     plastic
red  and
a lemon slice on top     The lobster is  I
would imagine     far from home  My
dad only ordered it here because I asked him to  I
shouldn’t forget my mom and brother    
all of us  at
a corner table in Maine     by glass and
goosebumps  My
clam chowder is not really what I had wanted  but
my brother suggested it     He’s older
and says  lobster
lungs are not for eating     ocean
pollutants  still
trapped inside     But I trust my dad as
he puts  the
best pieces on the edge of my plate and saves none  for
himself     Still     I want to check my phone  I
want to see the name I want to see    
Perhaps  the
lobster had a love back in the Atlantic    
Another  lobster
of similar upbringing     or maybe     a shy mussel?  Somewhere
not here     an electric signal via
satellite finds home  A
screen glows momentary     that knock-knock
buzz  The
white ladies nearby keep looking at my dad as he eats  My
parents leave every plate clean     and I  can only guess why        My clam chowder  is
getting cold     My mom wants to hear
about my friends  back
at school     I feel bad for the lobster  cooked
alive in the pot     Outside the window  a
stainless steel sky     the cloudy
upwards condensation  forming
against the stratosphere     I wait for
the slow boiling  and
the salt to give my end some flavor     I
just want  to
relate to something     but the lobster
must  have
had its own lexicon     for ocean  floor     for always never drowning     for the creature  next
door with big strange eyes     The
lobster  wasn’t
in the right seminars     never learned
the words  queer
theory     or     feminist methodologies  and
whose fault is that?     My mom takes my
bowl  finishes
my chowder     and wipes her mouth  She
is the only one who still talks with me in Chinese  In
Chinese I am a household creature     a
domestic  vernacular     I only know how to name what I see at home  By
home I mean where I don’t get goosebumps  even
when the heater breaks     Is the ocean
cold  or
burning?     I wish the lobster were
alive  to
tell me     I wish away my secrets     pretend  Chinese
is my only tongue     Thus everything I
hide  disappears     If I don’t know how to say something  that
means it isn’t true     My brother finishes
his soup  himself
and scrapes the bowl     He asks who I
keep texting  I
tell all my lies in English     By now             the lobster  has
been consumed speechless     I’m told  my
dad was once an aerospace engineer     precision  his
first language     I want to be a formula  a
measurable prediction     For every
action  there
is an equal and extinguishable consequence  To
inherit is to combust     I am a timid
explosion  No
one teaches girls like me to yell     I
want  a
hunger mouthwatered into love     I want
to want  out
loud     but we are in Maine     and no one  is
speaking     All I’m saying is     dilute  anything
enough and eventually it’ll be water  again     meaning anything can be made smooth  and
necessary     My Chinese is the
water     I speak it  and
make myself mandatory     Outside the
window  Maine
is the color of an apple harvest  I
want to be grocery shopping     to teach
myself  how
to pick the ripest fruit     as my mom
did  when
she first came to this country     She’s
ready  to
go now     having taken napkins for her
purse  Wherever
we go next     I let all of them decide  like
I am a child again     running circles in
the kitchen  my
mom feeding me apple slices that I let drop to the floor  She
bends to pick them up     rinses them at
the sink  and     in case they are still dirty     eats them herself  We
are walking back to the car to find some new scenery  I
trip to keep up     I am always rinsing
and making excuses  like     wasn’t it just yesterday I left my dinner plates  shining     my saliva the only evidence of a feast? In a bar on West 65th and Detroit, I am thinking
again about Alaskan wood  frogs. How they freeze with the elements, when
temperatures drop, to survive.  The lime the bartender touched. Forced into the
clear neck of the glass bottle  I drink from floats in the golden craft like a
lily. I think to myself: all of this  could be a poem. Everyone in this bar is starry-eyed. Arctic ice, the Columbia  Glacier, all the coastlines. The dissonance here
is funny. No punchline needed.  A man walks into the bar without a gun but with
a woman. The danger still  imminent. Swimming beneath the surface of
intent. They embrace in a behavior   of embracing I’ve witnessed lions perform before
falling into maned bodies  of the wild. We are connected in our affections.
We love. Traverse the heart  without clear direction. Without real protocol.
Even outside the trigger’s scope.  In this way we make ourselves vulnerable and
call said vulnerability bravery.  Up close but far away the night, which is felt
most at night, is unreal. A thing  I cannot reach but know is there. All my life I
have been invisible. Been waiting  to be called a home. To recognize the song of
earth – the branch the brook  the streaming the snapping – without having ever
to discern the sound. The Great   Barrier Reef, black bodies, the Giant Ibis.
Tonight, to be the poem written  in the back of a book at a time when the poet
would rather be held by someone  he fiercely loves is the goal. We are all
amateurs of plot. Like many others leading  up to this week, this week America is drowning.
An epic poem about the body  aching all the time. About not wanting to die.
About wanting to live forever  comes on and no one is singing along. No one
knows the words to disillusion-  ment. It is 39º tonight. And raining. The
government is shutting down tomorrow.  There are child refugees dying of dehydration
while $3 million dollars are crowd   surfed in support of a wall along the southern border
of this doleful place. Kiribati  will soon be no longer. 50-foot waves taunt
California’s coast. At this rate, we  cannot save the Maldives. Everything is disappearing
slowly before our eyes.  What would it mean to be the poem and not the
poet? In what way would I be saved  from all of this? I am trying to see what it
takes to withstand the elements  of survival. To convert glycogen into glucose is
the body’s greatest invention.  I am learning to sit within an image. To survive
cold winters. To be the first  thing moving, as the ice around me thaws, with
sound escaping my throat. To the polestar I leave my alien regalia.  To mercy I leave whatever.  Any fool can get into an ocean,  but it takes a hero to get out of one.  Wind chimes off-key in the alcove.  We are a smear of obscenity  on the lake whose only peace  is a hole where the moon  abandoned us. 
Sometimes  the speeches are so beautiful  it hurts.  At night
before I go  to sleep, I am already dreaming.  I examine my feelings without  feeling anything. 
Consider the hands  that write this letter. 
I will consider you,  as you twist in a rapt mechanical dream.  Destroy yourself, if you don’t know.  If a rifle fires a shot in the woods,  whose body first hits the ground?  In a wailful choir the small gnats mourn.  Where are the songs of spring?  In a cloud, in a tree, now I live.  I have a seat in the abandoned theatre.  I wait the hour when gods have more to give. and we will name the island after  the summer when the gonorrhea gang    finally learned to stop kissing  with their mouths open, when the girls    who we were, with our amethyst bruises turned  violets un-bludgeoned by our blooming, are    lipped in metallic blue and rimmed in black gossamer  and hung with hoop earrings, our sweet    names cursived between the bamboo gold.  and on the island, we will be the exotics:    we will be young and untouched and they will
crave  our fat bodies, our bulging mouths, our    sea salt and creole and we can say  anything and be beautiful    doing so, and on the island, anyone who loves
us  will be full of flower and flaw    and we will love them black and we will kiss
their palms  and we will decorate their faces with gemstones
and    on the island, we will dance to the Whitney
song  that makes us cry, we will lilt a terrible    dance beneath a quiet moon and we will glow
like some fire-lit and  sky-bound balloon, some gorgeous and floating ornament. Young Americans Tongue-Touching in The Basement Party Right Before The Apocalyptic End   and she reaches behind her
back to turn up the Frank Ocean track,  her tongue still pressed into
another girl’s, both their hips split open  like a split-open-something
and the world ends. the world ends with   the mocked sound coming from
the sofa where two other young americans  pretty-fuck each other into
an ember of green-gold good-got passion. the world  ends. the small girl with her
septum pierced is python-skinned and python-eyed   –blue, opaque,
throatless–and all the young americans push their bodies  into one another in their
intimate attempts to concede. and the world ends.  and someone wields a wedding
song, lays it down like a chiffon curse   draped over a gazebo, the
whole sky an orange and opening mouth,  the deciduous trees leafing
small corpses, the small corpses stuck in the teeth  of the mouth of the sky. and
the world ends. someone says grace against   a wavelength of violet light.
everyone drinks a bottle of hairspray and  their insides electrify.
someone tacks decayed rose petals to the wall,  someone strikes on a string
of christmas lights, the basement is gorgeous   and swelling with their
bodies, their veins luminous and the basement a city  skyline and pine and dust and
the world ends. and the world ends. and the world  ends in bright white ecstasy,
everyone screaming the names of the lover who is not   loving them presently but is
in the same room loving someone else. the lover  loving presently still sucks
on the collarbone despite what they have been called.  after the world ends, we call
this empathy. after the world ends, we call it kindness,   give new names to our old
intimacies: call a hand-hold a french kiss,  call a bitch-slap a prayer.
at the basement party, all of the young americans  have grinded one another into
soft gold. the christmas lights flicker.   the girls kiss the girls with their mouths open,  their pink muscles tied and tying.  Beloved   —I had only ever heard of you. Yours was a name I could not speak.   To speak your name was to break a covenant with language, was   to admit to language’s vanity. For years I wrestled with an angel   that was really a sack of potatoes with costume wings. Even still, I lost.   You were elsewhere, washing a fish, planting a patch of weeds in the center   of the strawberries. & I lived without grace, telling women I could see them   as I gazed into my hands, neglecting friends to whom I vowed to administer   the machines of my listening, breaking the trust of my employers, lying when   asked if I felt what I said I had felt. Beloved, how could I have known   you would be waiting for me anyway with your salamanders & asteroids,   your jazz piano & panic attacks, your bright chamomile & medicine   breath? What did I do to deserve you? This nearly untenable tenderness,   the silence of your love like the trunk of a Buick buried a mile under the earth.   Beloved, here’s how the story goes: once I was given a body & I hated it;   I hated my body; I hid in my hate; & then I left; & there you were—  1.  Sex ed. came early, arrived in the form of having us gather in a circle and ask. But first the teacher held up diagrams, unholy-ed the body with mechanics— ovum, tubes, minora and majora. I don’t remember any mention of pleasure, and I didn’t ask—(the first time I touched myself the elm flowered and I never considered the two blooms as an answer. The question was is pleasure a sacred act?) The teacher held up a tampon, passed it like besamim , asked us if we knew what it was and when Arielle guessed the tampon was a candle the room lit with laughter, I joined, knowing what it was, feeling somehow, the inner ache that awaited me and the teacher said something about the body needing to ready itself in order to receive, so I considered my fingers and how far I would need to root until something broke.   2.  In teaching us
that questioning The Word is sacred, one could say that every question is
sacred. A child, I could not wrap my head around many things, a bookmark, for
instance, or how a book could contain so many pages one would need to mark it.
I asked my mom and she told me sometimes we can’t obtain the knowledge all in
one sitting.   3.  By now I know the
hand is holy, it can perform so many tricks. But there is a law that says my
skin and the scripture’s skin is a sacrilegious contact—why would god make an
object that can’t be touched when, already, I’ve touched so many beautiful
things? I’ll hold the yad for fun, but never recite from the Torah in any
formal way—the parents and teachers are disappointed I don’t want to become a
Bat Mitzvah, a woman in god’s eyes, even though it was years before when they
let us loose in the woods for an entire weekend and the landscape told me truth
that no hands or words will ever touch—   4.  and in the woods they hand us a thick packet of questions. How to Identify a Tree by Its Parts. 1. Students should find plant specimens of their choice, or as specified by you, to identify but I’ve brought with me a separate notebook, one I hide among layers of clothes. At night I turn my headlamp on to witness my tiny, secret scrawl. The popular girl’s body—how many ways to metaphor the breast? Bud, budding, a flower—the body’s stalk? 2. They should observe the main structures of the plant. The camp counselor takes a group of us on a hike, while our teachers stay behind. It rained last night—we slide, muddy ourselves, and after, in the cafeteria, he removes the slender bar from his tongue, shows us how water can squirt through. In the packet, I describe the forest in spring—muddied, wet, buds. 3. They should try to identify the plant by its fruits or flowers (if not present, continue to step 5). Note the flower’s color, shape, size, and cluster type. I press leaves in-between thick glossed pages of books, and at night I try to write about the counselor, the hole in his tongue.   5.  By the time I am fifteen, I wanted more than I’d ever wanted. I removed the mattress from my room, and didn’t miss it, my body so in flux. For years I slept with blankets and books in a giant heap on the ground, which meant maybe I hadn’t ever left the interpretive act of midrash— I don’t care if we erase the word god it’s overused and you can roll it around in your mouth until it’s absent. I read that mysticism means absorption into the deity, attained through self-surrender — I wrote this in a high school journal, but mainly the entries began with a boy who visited me in my nest of blankets and books, his touch, the answer.   6.  Why must we question in order to lead a
religious life? I never
think of a religious life as anything but, and it takes practice to try to say
so. For instance, before college we spent three weeks in the woods, and three
of those days alone. I thought those days would be my holy days—solitude, time
lapping slowly forward. I chose to fast because god recognizes those who fast—I
wanted to be in my body more. I got naked under the sun— I was hungry—and thought
the sun would feed me, but there were so many flies buzzing, I couldn’t absorb
anything. I had never seen so many and after three, four, ten hours, I grew
loneliness out of hunger and flies. I dressed myself and tried to write, but
all I wrote about were the flies. When that was finished and I still had days
ahead of me, I killed one and took its pieces apart—transparent wing, compound
eye, antennae—I pressed the parts in my notebook and wondered what night would
bring and if the flies would return. I labeled the collection of parts “on
trying to be in the light and failing.” 
The fountain
clogged with plague frogs and our hair  went unwashed.
I said no, because you asked  if prayer
worked. A hammer works. A man  is work to a
mushroom no matter what  he’s buried
with–       I know none of this sounds  like an
apology, but bear        with me:  the sunflower
field was so dazzling  I missed the
funeral. My shirt tucked in.   Here’s a country of
statues crushed under  the weight of
migrating ladybugs.      If  men could,
they would melt other men down to  gold.    Mercy, you said, as if the fire  blew itself
out. As if the town’s missing  children woke up in the silo unharmed. This is my box
of twilight and inside  is everything that disappeared when  we weren’t looking like
glaciers and God,  the lonely
astronaut waving as she  drifts from
one starfield to another. Here’s  the stone I
found that glimmered in my hands  like a promise
made mineral. My name  the frozen
lake my body treads across.   This time, I’ll
walk into the house and ask  why my hands
feel so dirty. A rose pinned  to my shirt
like a throbbing ear, an ear  listening to
the wreckage scraping at  the bottom of
your words. The candle flame  like a tongue asking the room for water. I.  I called my dad for the rest of the story   in mid-spring chuckwalla  lizards shed skin and stories  told in halves are reborn  as: nana migrated up thru the north,  el paso or maybe further east  somehow,   with a sprig of thyme for courage  and a spine of aloe vera for protection  on a dusty road outside mexico city  rebeca hitches a ride with a traveling  doctor and rides thru the coahuila desert  straight to the u.s. border  or she walks from pueblo to pueblo,  cooks thru the homes of midwives,  farmers, hacendados and bandits   she ends up in louisiana, el bosque bayou:  mujer de méxico – no hablaba ingles  trabajando en una cocina francés  dad dijo:   my nana was a curandera  de la cocina  she just had to stick her finger in  the pot  and stir.

With a final line from Blake   I
turn on the radio and  hear
trumpets and here’s  Raul Esparza all marry me  a
little, love me just  enough,
and sweetly  I
slip out the bathroom  window
and into my tidy  little
car on the street which is  a
femoral artery to a formerly bad  part
of town where the mortuary  at
the tippy-top of the city  had
been turned into a restaurant  some
summers ago and everyone is delighted  to
pay twenty or thirty dollars for their tiny plates,  and
so sick with longing am I I parallel  park
and climb the street like a ladder.  Hello
hello, and I wait for a table. Outside,  people
are standing in line for ice cream  and
waffle cones for their ice cream  and
I can smell it all and I ask for a newspaper  while
I wait but oh no there’s no news  anymore,
not for a long time. Well  some
music, then. We can have  all
the music we want. I’m seated  at
last, and all the waiting over,  made
to drink water from a pale blue  mason
jar by an open second-story  window.
I’m pleased by the heavy  cream-colored
recycled paper menus  and
the sans-serif font which everywhere  adorns
them and I ask the waiter  where
is all the food on the menu,  anyways?
She is older than me her  eyes
two too-warm chocolate wafers, and she  asks
me what would eating be for. I say fair,  but
why the restaurant and she says we like  the
real estate. And what a nice view,  she
says, that trusty white-steel bridge  stretching
its young body over Cherry Creek,  and
how fine the spindles of its great back  up
and away from heaven, and I ask her  what
are they waiting for down there anyway,  and
we lean out the window to see  the
people waiting between  the
great many Amazon Prime  boxes
which have been made the lungs  of
our city. What are they waiting for, the sun  isn’t
even hot today, it’s just bright.  She
refills my mason jar and she tells me  they
just like waiting, and at my table  she
lights a candle in the sunshine. My
father spreads Miracle Whip onto my palms, leads me to a hive on the back porch.  He says, hold  them in front of you and close your eyes . When my lids  lift
open I see bees,  golden storm humming in my hand  –
their small tongues  washing  onto my skin in a
whisper  of
sweet . It tickles.  I
laugh.  The beginning is always good.  When
I realize what they are, remember their stingers,  I
start to cry, beg my father to make it stop, please make them leave.  He says to close my eyes
again, and when  I
open them, the insects are gone.  I told my mother  this
story, years later.  She said it wasn’t
true.  I
must have dreamed it as a child, but when I reach  for
the quick fingers of my thieving memory,  I
remember the feeling of wanting  until
I no longer wanted, of my father    at home and standing
over me  like some god I did not have a name for. & what is a praise anyway but  an obnoxious speech / you’s in the
presence  of a God. I bring fuchsia sky after an
aching  rain / that makes your unhealed bones  creak. Tickle the moon and create moon-  light. Endless                    sea to sea.  There is no afterlife. No sonofabitch who  can kill me / notorious. Blow out  kneecaps summoning the wind. Strike  you down by your lies / watch your mouth  watch your blood / clots. Have you wishing  you spoke black. Warrior of afflictions.  Play for limbs. Make you wanna do a dance  against the water / incinerate whole villages  with my pinky. Barely break a sweat. Barely break  & you sulk. Bulging with disdain / you can’t defeat me.  You come from my breast. Licked my nipple clean &  still you only dream of miracles/ see heaven.  Never darkness and how it creates uncupped light.  You never pray Oya / but think Jesus can  stop earth’s cracking.     People buy guns / today someone bought a gun / at the
same moment / I got groceries / the same moment / I got off / today I
masturbated because I didn’t know / what else to do / because I was alone / in
a way that felt / worse than usual / I am clinging to myself / to my
self-imposed deadlines / to write / to mop the kitchen / the promises I make to
myself / the promises I want to make / to someone else / when my hand / was in
my shorts / it felt like everything and nothing / all at once / when I closed
my eyes there was nothing / good to think about / the high of the orgasm /
hardly worth it / when I remembered / the last person who touched me / the way
I love her / the way I miss her / empty nightstand drawer / I have no toys / my
exes have them / mostly little things / bullets / I use my hands / for myself /
flat bike tire / noisy box fan / leaky dishwasher / things I’ve fixed / things
I’ve broken / I am broken / in a way / that all of us are / in a way there’s
sort of / not words for / I have touched a real gun exactly / one time /
touched it real gentle / like I loved it / and feared it / ran one finger
slowly / along the silver barrel / it wasn’t loaded / yet / my ex’s father had
a gun collection / he was proud to show me this newest one / whatever kind it
was / it laid there on the kitchen table / he died / not from guns / from
alcohol / there was fresh deer meat in his freezer / the day his girlfriend
found him / dead on the living room floor / I read a poem about a gun / maybe it
was a news article / how even the talk / of a gun ban / made people more afraid
/ how everyone wanted to get their hands / on a gun / before they couldn’t /
when my hand was in my shorts / there was so much / I couldn’t touch.
childhood summers wrap hands around me, silver  with
half-loving promises of shimmering heat,  and
i’m turning my pockets inside out for loose  change—dimes
and nickels for popsicles that evaporate  in
the sun, leaving the taste of metal rising bitter  in
my mouth. i collect these coins and ghosts,   light
candles in my father’s church. i’m a ghost’s  remembrance
of june, peeling the girl-silver  off
from my eyes. my lips cherry-red, bitter  with
popsicle stick splinters. i’m a mid-august heat  wave
that kills thousands. i puddle, i evaporate,  i
condense again. i’m the dark river and the loose   throat
of the water singing. i’m the bible’s loose  woman and i dream about touching ghosts,  or
a girl’s fingers where i’m wounded. i evaporate  like
firework smoke in the morning. ghosthood silver  as
bicycle wheels or asphalt in the summer heat.  girlhood
as an unending wounding, bitter   to
remember. i’m alone in the chapel with bitter  shadows
around my ankles that beg to be let loose.  my
body, victimless. this is the inevitable heat-  stroke
that comes after the fire, girl becoming ghost  to
curl up in my bed, to twine silver  fingers
in my hair until she evaporates   in
the morning. but didn’t we all evaporate  when
the light hit us? i became the bitter-  ness
of incense. i grew up in a house of silver  ghosts,
buttoned my sisters’ dresses, gathered loose  cloth
and baby blankets to stitch into quilts. ghosts  at
the swimming pool and girls in the sun-heat   that
white marble tombs radiate. summer heat  as
a metaphor for a heaven that only evaporated  when
i reached for it with hands that loved ghosts  more
than god. girl-poison on my cheeks, bitter  as
memory, not forgetting that whatever i lose  will
find its way back: coins and june nights silver   and
alight with firefly ghosts. a girl’s hands and the heat  she
left behind. the silver on her eyes evaporated:  a
girl’s mouth no longer bitter, a ghost’s love set loose. 
Then the LORD caused to rain upon
Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven; and He
overthrew those cities, and all the Plain, and all the inhabitants of the
cities, and that which grew upon the ground. — Genesis 19:24-25    i spray paint my personal sainthood onto the stone walls of
sodom  because i’m in love with a girl  who gold-leaf-haloes her own body  who sanctifies herself  who shatters the glass between her
and heaven    i know a crucifixion when i see one                             and this
city is full of executions  we live and love condemned  carried outside the city gates to
a skull-place  holding her hand                                       knowing her
and knowing her    barefingered i split the flowers apart to offer them one by
one to her lips  and this gleaming devotion                      loves
the sin and the sinner  loves the prayer her open mouth makes and
the holy that follows  my breath in her naked body    how the sand fused into glass under the weight of heat  east to west no difference but desert  resurrection has her fingers tangled in death’s long hair    i carve light from the air  and she cradles it like a child
wrapped in burial cloth    i’m in love with a girl who turned back to look at the
brimstone cloud  my handprints on the saltglass of her chest      my breath on
the seacurl of her lips    we make our own sort of holiness  here in the burning outside the city walls
