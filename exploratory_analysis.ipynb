Teach me the proper tense\\nfor this deadlock, both of us waiting\\non blocked signals, too many messages\\nlost en route\\nfrom me to you. Call it\\nbad gateway, faulty router, the hopeless\\ndistances between you and me. Parametrize\\nthis hunger we share—your insolent hands\\nand greedy gaze, my appetite for the space\\nyou inhabit, for your all-American palette\\nand blue-eyed shield. No fair how your\\nsoft, languid drawl disarms all the bombs\\nin the minefield. Perhaps for you a minefield’s\\njust\\na field, for you a mother tongue\\nis not some rune that breaks your mouth\\nand heart.\\nGive me your childhood\\nin all its aching glory, dirt bike collisions\\nand back-lawn barbecues, firecracker\\nmishaps, a pledge\\nto believe in. Give me\\nthis America\\nyou so revere,\\npass me your vision through our rites\\nof violent longing,\\nyour fantasy\\nof gleaming city upon a hill, yes, force me\\nto see\\nwhat you see, to love it too.\\n\\n\\x0c2\\nProof. B\\n\\u200b y Incomplete Conditionals:\\nIf, despite your crass renunciations of feeling,\\nthe flashing stop light of your eyes, your parrying\\nhis every touch; if, despite these measures, love\\npummels you still, makes you weak; if your mother\\ntells you the words you are never to utter too soon;\\nif only sound instantiates meaning;\\nif betrayal is not an ambush but a siege;\\nif you relax into the lull of your days, close your eyes;\\nif you really think you’ve retired the old coat\\nof your longing, then you are wrong,\\naren’t you? If, when you meet him, you bury his name\\nwithin your chest; if, when he leaves, you call him back,\\nthen you deserved it, didn’t you? If still you back away,\\nproclaim yourself unknowable, then of course\\nhe calls your bluff; if you blank out your face,\\nthen he sketches in your tenderness; if you fasten\\nyour lips, then he wrenches the words\\nfrom your selfish mouth. If you encrypt your\\nevery feeling; if he tries to break your cyphers,\\nbreaks you instead; if he fails to understand\\na single thing about you; if he knows you\\nnonetheless.\\n\\n\\x0c3\\nThe Algorithm You Never Learned\\nIf there is no lexicon for loss, return\\nthe empty language, return\\nhand clamped over yearning mouth or air\\nbereft of sound. Perhaps this\\nis the algorithm you never learned: love\\nas stochastic process, as step after step\\nof bewildering and equally-likely\\ndecisions, non-deterministic,\\nnone of them easy; love as random walk\\nacross the ravaged field of time.\\nTo love someone is to walk\\ninto fire for her, not knowing\\nwhether you can live with the scars.\\nTo pick up the phone at 3 am, not knowing\\nwhen you’ll put it down. To finish\\nwhat you have to say. To be wide awake,\\nunblinking, brave—even if it doesn’t last.\\n\\n\\x0c4\\nThe Only Story\\nTwenty years, now, and I’ve been telling\\nmy only story. June, Taipei’s skyline\\nchoked at the brink of dawn, lovely\\nenough to calm the throttle of\\nmy heart. A crash in the bedroom,\\nSpringsteen stopped mid-croon, my mother\\nshouting Call 911, my hands dangling\\nlike ornaments. July, what Mia said\\nthe first time she made me cry: \\u200bit’s not\\nyour fault\\u200b, how my heart twitched\\nbut did not thaw. This I know: to be loved\\nby her is to have a shadow even\\non sunless days. This I know: her words\\ncan burn. And yet she’s always here\\nfor me. All the rest keep moving, in\\nand out of focus, impossible to pin down\\nand always out of reach. Twenty years,\\nnow, and I’ve been telling\\nmy only story. How I turned my eyes\\nfrom the wreck of living, from\\nthe stretcher on which the body left,\\nmy hands dangling like ornaments\\nSpringsteen stopped mid-croon, and Mia,\\nMia, Mia who flays me with her\\nboundless rage, Mia’s lips gentled\\nagainst my brow, \\u200byou know it’s not your fault.\\n\\n\\x0c'"

Links  FAQ                Back to Issue Twenty-Six.  After Essex Hemphill  BY JERICHO BROWN    The night is the night. So Say the stars that light us As we kneel before one Another, illegal and illegal Like Malcolm X. This is His park, this part Of the capital where we Say please with our mouths Full of each other, no one Hungry as me against this Tree. This tree, if we push Too hard, will fall. But if I don’t push at all, call me A sissy. Somebody ahead Of me seeded the fruit- Bearing forest. The night Is my right. Shouldn’t I Eat? Shouldn’t I repeat,  It was good , like God?      THE LONG WAY  BY JERICHO BROWN    Your grandfather was a murderer. I’m glad he’s dead.  He invented the toothbrush, But I don’t care to read his name  On the building I walk through  To avoid the rain. He raped women Who weren’t yet women.  I imagine the wealth he left When you turn red. I imagine you as a baby  Bouncing on a rapist’s knee. I like my teeth Clean. I like to stay warm  And healthy. I get it. Then I get it Again: my oral hygiene and your memory  Avoiding one another  Like a girl who walks the long way To miss the neighborhood bully  Who’d really rather just beat up on somebody New. I can’t help you. I can’t hug you.  I can’t grip your right hand, though It never held a gun, though it never  Covered a lovely mouth, and you can’t pay me To cross the ground floor without wishing  I could spit or mar some slick surface  And not think of who will have to do the cleaning. We’d all still be poor. I’d end up drenched  Going around. You’d end remembering What won’t lead to a smile that gleams  In dark places.      the peaches  BY JERICHO BROWN    I choose these two, bruised— Maybe too ripe to take, fondling Them as I toss them each Into my cart, the smaller With its stem somewhat Intact—because they remind me Of the girls who won’t be girls Much longer, both sealed And secured like a monarch’s Treasure in a basement below The basement of the house I inherited. I’ve worked hard and want To bring them something sweet So they know I’ve missed them More than anyone else. But first, I weigh the peaches, pay For them, make the short drive To my childhood Home of latches, mazes, And little locked doors. Every key Mine now, though I’ve hidden a few From myself. I pride myself On my gifts. I can fashion for you A place to play, and when you think It’s dark there, I hand you Fruit like two swollen bulbs Of light you can hold onto, Watch your eyes brighten as you eat.

So Say the stars that light us As we kneel before one Another, illegal and illegal Like Malcolm X. This is His park, this part Of the capital where we Say please with our mouths Full of each other, no one Hungry as me against this Tree. This tree, if we push Too hard, will fall. But if I don’t push at all, call me A sissy. Somebody ahead Of me seeded the fruit- Bearing forest. The night Is my right. Shouldn’t I Eat? Shouldn’t I repeat,  It was good , like God?      THE LONG WAY  BY JERICHO BROWN    Your grandfather was a murderer. I’m glad he’s dead.  He invented the toothbrush, But I don’t care to read his name  On the building I walk through  To avoid the rain. He raped women Who weren’t yet women.  I imagine the wealth he left When you turn red. I imagine you as a baby  Bouncing on a rapist’s knee. I like my teeth Clean. I like to stay warm  And healthy. I get it. Then I get it Again: my oral hygiene and your memory  Avoiding one another  Like a girl who walks the long way To miss the neighborhood bully  Who’d really rather just beat up on somebody New. I can’t help you. I can’t hug you.  I can’t grip your right hand, though It never held a gun, though it never  Covered a lovely mouth, and you can’t pay me To cross the ground floor without wishing  I could spit or mar some slick surface  And not think of who will have to do the cleaning. We’d all still be poor. I’d end up drenched  Going around. You’d end remembering What won’t lead to a smile that gleams  In dark places.      the peaches  BY JERICHO BROWN    I choose these two, bruised— Maybe too ripe to take, fondling Them as I toss them each Into my cart, the smaller With its stem somewhat Intact—because they remind me Of the girls who won’t be girls Much longer, both sealed And secured like a monarch’s Treasure in a basement below The basement of the house I inherited. I’ve worked hard and want To bring them something sweet So they know I’ve missed them More than anyone else. But first, I weigh the peaches, pay For them, make the short drive To my childhood Home of latches, mazes, And little locked doors. Every key Mine now, though I’ve hidden a few From myself. I pride myself On my gifts. I can fashion for you A place to play, and when you think It’s dark there, I hand you Fruit like two swollen bulbs Of light you can hold onto, Watch your eyes brighten as you eat.

Venus, Aged  BY MEGAN FERNANDES    Your shyness is like a science— a light lapsing, shoulders of stalk silk, small fruit where your ears should live and your eye, light like a current traveling across the wood of the table. When you talk in circles, it reminds me of Lonnie Johnson. You make small imitations of my voice. You turn my pout into a little character. Like a children’s book. Like the one about a tiger who came to tea right at a child’s bedtime. I let you do things. I let you order. I tell you about the tumors singing to each other in my mother’s brain. You say something about your sun, the son, the moonless spitting in the night, your sadness like a cradled apricot in the palm of my hands. Your hands are rough when I cup them, we compare lines— all healthy heartbreaks etched across our lunar palms, all captive pathways of animals and hairlines we have loved. What is a line anyways. A small horizon of age. A pursuit. Your leg gently in rest, the sweet citrus of drink between us. The air is vulnerable, like any small tease might hurt, so we are careful with each other’s pasts. We mostly talk about what is in front of us which is nothing we can really have, which must exist parallel to the lives we have built like a rabbit’s ear blushing in the night, the blood shooting upwards to its apex, its heaven, the twin celestial leaves atop its head. Here I am, your crisis in white. With flowers up and down my dress, with a gold cuff digging into my arm. What part of our bodies are not fauna. What part of us is actually here.

Valentine,  BY COREY MILLER    The moon reminds me of the elongated moon of your body, the moon with its little cliché ass, the moon with its old notions of the soul. I forget the details  of my childhood but not the glacier-ironed fields I’ve retroactively placed you in like a bookmark in a memoir, hoping a bookmark could be read  as part of the story. What is it you’re made of there? The breath of a doe climbing a ladder of cold air. Something close to romantic  but untainted by the unreality of romance, by the rose holding love tight by the thorns, unable to be refreshed  even by the Modernists. Nor is your image ruined by our modern love of reality. So what is it you’re made of here? Something in-between,  a tale breathed back and forth so often that we’re finally telling the same mangled version, like our trip  to the redwoods where the sun grows steeply up from the ground  as if some kintsugi god had stitched the broken pot of the forest with gold.           Corey Miller has an MFA from the Michener Center for Writers and was the Fall 2014 Philip Roth Resident at Bucknell University. His poetry has appeared in Best New Poets , Boston Review , Denver Quarterly , Gulf Coast , Kenyon Review Online , Missouri Review , Narrative , the Southern Review , and elsewhere.

Three Fields to Leave You  BY THEIS ANDERSON    Winner of the 2018 Adroit Prize for Poetry Selected by Alex Dimitrov  My own undressing bores me but it does not bore you. There is an economics to this. Heliotrope: the staging  of a pre-dawn field. Little  footsteps—4am—an even snow. Somewhere  a daughter is  abjected. It must go on record that such occurrences take place, disproportionately, at  the centre of a field. That said, there are fields we can choose from.  In one  she has frozen to death.  [ Paradoxical undressing: a phenomenon  [frequently seen in cases of lethal hypoth  [ermia in which, shortly before death, ind  [ividuals will remove all or most of their c  [lothing. Because of this, exposure casual  [ties are often misidentified as victims of  [a violent crime.  Another: plastic  forks. It is not unusual to dredge one’s hands through layer upon\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0layer of unspeakable  whiteness and find something other  than wheat. To snap the prongs from a brittler frame. To hold them in one’s mouth.  The final field  is printless. Bare. She melts it  inside-out.           Theis Anderson is a poet and student of English Literature at Emmanuel College, University of Cambridge. Their work has featured in Magma Poetry , M enacing Hedge , and Poetry London among others.

Perhaps, this one, such as it is, will be enough. But it won’t be. In the night, in that benign darkness, I sing what I’m not able to bear. You left me, old love, in Tulsa. I dream of rain and animal grief and my arms, which themselves dream of other, unknowable lives. A forgettable career lifting onerous weight. Aesthetically pleasing musculature. I have never been here. Not before. I spent hours learning secret handshakes and regions of the map which show nothing here of worth or interest or life. I am dying, I think. I am hungry. I want to go home. What is open, at this hour, in this small place of the sad world? What is burning down and what is so sweet? What aches like a sick tooth in your mouth, planet Earth? Go slow, sun and moon, go slow. Give me this hour. This dance. That bird screaming forever.           Paul Guest is the author of four collections of poetry and one memoir. He is a Guggenheim Fellow and the recipient of a Whiting Award. His poems have appeared in Poetry , the Southern Review , the Paris Review , the Kenyon Review , Tin House , and elsewhere. He teaches in the Creative Writing program at the University of Virginia, and lives in Charlottesville.

Get out of here with your dog-eared under-arms, baby.  You have to pretend to be dead or wear it for a good reason. So I wore it to the movies & I cried at the previews.  I wore it to the cafe & I asked for some alternative milk. I wore it to the protest & they took a picture of me without my permission. I spilled beer on it  at the punk show. I took the train going the wrong way. I learned my lesson & I took it back, tucked it into a box & then under my bed.  I wore it to space. I tried to be a star-fucker but I forgot protection. I wore it to a brand new city. I tried to live in the moment but my bank account overdrew.  I listened to “Heaven knows I’m miserable now” & it got stuck in the zipper. I hopped up & down & it didn’t come off. I went to the park & I pretended to read a classic on a bench.  I held flowers then I put them in my hair. I went to parades. I said “Woo!” because I’m a “Woo!” girl. I had a few drinks & I said “Esooo!” instead. I walked under the archways.  I threw pennies into the fountains. I went to the readings. I wrote down my favorite lines. I passed by all the mirrors.  I touched all of the sandals on sale. And it still got colder. And the leaves still changed color. And you still couldn’t see me.           Melissa Lozada-Oliva is a poet & educator living in New York by way of Boston. She is the author of chapbooks Plastic Pajaros & Rude Girl is Lonely Girl! (pizza pi press) & peluda (Button Poetry), which explores the intersecting narratives of body image, hair removal & Latina identity. Her works have been featured on Buzzfeed, REMEZCLA, Glamour Magazine, Huffington Post, Upworthy, the Guardian , and her mom’s Facebook statuses. She has taught classes with the Blueshift Journal & Strength of Doves. She is currently an MFA candidate at New York University.

My mother’s in blue, the slender straps, the rich  and rumpled linen. She’s a splinter.  Her sister’s chosen floral for her second wedding, she’s chosen a man  who wears camo to the Shop & Save, who listens to John Denver and cleans his guns in the unheated basement. As best as I remember,  he was kind. None of us knows what happens behind the locked doors of our neighbors’ houses. We were raised in the strip malls suburbs, land of  cul de sacs and smooth tan sidewalks. We were raised to believe that violence  was what happened elsewhere. When the camera finally catches us we’re blinking into the late-August sun, the forsythia by the side porch blooming  in a sickly sweetness, though it’s the wrong season  for that, so the memory bends and ripples. There’s a knot inside the synapse  where remembering should be. Years later, after so many other things went wrong, the groom’s son came into his father’s room  and shot him as he slept. They lived  close to us. I could, at thirteen, have walked there after school. I never did. It was the suburbs,  no one walked anywhere. There were guns in our house, too.           Nancy Reddy is the author of Double Jinx (Milkweed Editions, 2015), a 2014 winner of the National Poetry Series, and Acadiana (Black Lawrence Press, 2018). Poems have appeared in or are forthcoming from Pleiades , Blackbird , the Iowa Review , Smartish Pace , and elsewhere. The recipient of a Walter E.

A ringlet of black hair wound around the air’s crooked finger. I’m talking about power, current  events foster flashback: defibrillate. Embellish the gasp so it becomes a seam in the lung, a place to say it started, the learning of warmth a second time.  A bird perched on the scarecrow’s shoulder without hungry intent. So you realize you are alive, now what? You leave the sugar out and complain of ants. Tremble, I command. Then I ask, why do you tremble? Object in mirror may be uglier than it appears. Perhaps sadder.  Perhaps object in mirror is not in mirror at all. Share your loss, o quiet creature of thirst. I imagine a spark’s reflection should also electrify something. You are left with ants, a pilgrimage of them. On the pillow case,  in your wine glasses. On your way to class. In Twitter DMs. In your sleep. Sure, you can cauterize a void, but you have a gap even in your teeth. You cry into his pillow so he dreams of you at night. Sunny rain, lion cub. Delicate inertia. The mortician wakes up already drunk on bad wine.  All that is asked: what are you carrying, put it down.  (This title is taken from Safia Elhillo’s “Alternate Ending”.)

At the sight of him his mother faints. He catches her  Just in time and lays her down on the floor. When his sister comes in from slopping hogs to find her Brother at the table with his long legs kicked out And their mother senseless on the linoleum, she sighs  And unbuttons his shirt. The wound isn’t visible yet, It’s still drifting around inside his body, bouncing Under his skin like a man swimming under ice, Desperate to find the place where he fell through.  When the wound surfaces, that’s when she’ll know Whether he’ll live or die. For now, his eyes are calm And blue. He asks her which boys have been bothering her At school. She knows not to ask him where he’s been.  When their mother comes to, she insists she’s fine. “It’s just this heat is all,” she says. After putting a pot Of coffee on, she says, “Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going upstairs and close my eyes awhile.”  There’s blood soaking through his white tee-shirt now. His sister pretends not to see it. They talk through the evening. Around midnight she tells him the sheets on his bed are clean. He thanks her and tells her he might sit on the porch,  Watch fireflies like he used to when he was little. In the morning his bed hasn’t been slept in. There’s no note On the kitchen table, just a few fireflies in a Mason jar, Holes punched in the tin lid so they can breathe.           Austin Smith ’s poems have appeared in the New Yorker , Poetry , New England Review , Yale Review , Sewanee Review , Virginia Quarterly Review , Pleiades , ZYZZYVA , Poetry East , and Midwest Quarterly , amongst others. His first full-length collection, ALMANAC , was chosen by Paul Muldoon for the Princeton Series of Contemporary Poets. His second collection, FLYOVER COUNTRY, was chosen by Susan Stewart for the same series, and is forthcoming from Princeton in September 2018. Smith received an MA in poetry from UC-Davis, an MFA in poetry from the University of Virginia, and was a Wallace Stegner fellow at Stanford University in Fiction, where he teaches courses in poetry, fiction, environmental literature, and documentary journalism. He was recently awarded a 2018 grant in prose from the National Endowment for the Arts.

Your left grips  the headboard. Your feeling face: eyes closed. You navigate me with your hips. Sight so beautiful, I have to laugh:  Now that’s some blk shit . And we are old enough to know how true that is, to savor the elegant fuck-  it-all that somehow carried our mothers’ and fathers’ mothers and fathers forward in this country that tries  so hard to make us unseen. Baldwin said they may not know what we want, but they know they wouldn’t want  to be blk in this country. That that was all that needed understanding. But wouldn’t they want to be us in this  moment—two bodies as pleasure’s pure insistence, escaping in ways our mothers and fathers might think us  too old for? In the short spell before we rouse at 3AM to again rattle each other, we’ll call the concierge—twice—  and report the boisterous high schoolers flanking our room, as if we weren’t just ruckus ourselves. When security  arrives to rap on their doors, there’s the satisfaction of teaching those kids a lesson. Also the worry of wondering  what the guard will see when he sees their skin. But the kids aren’t brown—we can tell by the casual and wholly appropriate  tone the officer takes with them. They are just children, as we maybe once were, and they aren’t making the same noise  we are—the well-earned and lusty disturbance that is creation, a history you don’t dare interrupt with a knock.      SEPARATING  BY KYLE DARGAN    “there is blood in the morning egg  that makes me turn and weep”  ~Audre Lorde  Between the work at work and the work at home, I rush inside a grocery to buy the bits for quick breakfasts  that leave me hungry  by the time I return to my office.  It is an organic market,  and as I shop I can hear my mother—  her mouth full of pennies— mocking each cent I overpay for staples. But time’s expense burns black holes in pockets,  so no detour to a cheaper store.  So honey priced like wine.  So six eggs for what would  buy twelve. All in the name  of time. It will be days before I have a moment when I can pause my pre-commute to click on the electric kettle, boil  water for steeping rooibos  and poaching eggs. Eventually,  I reach inside the refrigerator,  revisit the words “cage-free”  “pasture-raised” which all read, in my earlier haste, like gibberish strings of dollar signs. Cracked open, what the brown pods  release into the ramekin is a yolk-  yellow so plump and lucent.  I tear up thinking of all the weak  or sallow suns I have dropped  into water, of the stressed existences that made those eggs. What of my thin shell or my own yoke unbroken within me  (both functions of money, time,  deficits)? And I know nothing  about industrial farms. And I  understand so much of blackness  as what I do in spite of my caging. But I know I cannot buy another egg not laid by a bird I believe foraged, walked freely  under the sun—deciding  how to value her motion, her blood.  A bourgeois privilege, I know.  But if not to make that choice,  why else am I grinding myself down for these wages?           Kyle Dargan is the author of the forthcoming collection Anagnorisis (TriQuarterly/NUP, 2018). His four previous collections, all published by the University of Georgia Press, include Honest Engine , Logorrhea Dementia , Bouquet of Hungers and The Listening . He is the founder and editor of POST NO ILLS magazine (www.postnoills.com), and an associate professor of creative writing at American University in Washington, D.C., where he lives.

They were delicious, bright as hunter’s caps, squeaky meat. How long does it take, I thought  at each sponge-full. I thought, had my nails turned blue? I was scared by my child. I was left  by his father. Left over and over in the way men leave before leaving, each affair a little  practice, each abuse a little closer out the door to I can’t … But I could. For a long time. There is a theory  that pain carries down from generations. Trauma will out. A scientist I knew shook  pregnant mice in a tube, then measured how, months later, the babies ran. This was a boy  who loved boys and also me. He photographed me smoking a cigar. I wish I had that shot.  He told me he was afraid of men, but later, married one. Sometimes I think what happened to us  didn’t really happen to us. Not to our bones, but to our blood. Now my lover knows  the dog breathing, my wild mud pupils that relax in the spring trap of a hand,  brows like a hill road. My body is a doorway through which pain may pass. My blood holds  the mothers, all of the girls of the yard, girls of the trees, girls of the closed doors. Girls in jail.  The experiment was to traumatize the mothers. The trees had no answer. The world  held no reference. I ate to find out would I die.      Murder  BY ALISON STINE    It was here I saw my first murder. It was here I hit a bird with my car,  one of the hundreds in the fields, their wings folded like tulips.  The crows in the corn took off together— and then they were only ink clouds,  some chattering in the branches in the woods where the men hunt.  It was here the man I loved left me. I asked for a token, and he emptied  out his hands: no ring, no white dress, no child—but a blade of straw,  bleached, broken-off. I put it in my eye. In time, my iris  knitted a scar, a flash across the cornea, a blurring in the corner, always  out of reach, a way of weeping, a way to remember him all of my days.      Safe House  BY ALISON STINE    Because I could not keep you safe, I’m on my stomach, a willow finger  blistering my back. Because I wasn’t born yet, there will be jangles wherever  I walk, and a leather line lead me. Cold bullet center me. The houses  by the river welcomed you with sticks. My mother and her sisters swept out  the pig sheds. I broke through a hedge at cul-de-sacs end. The houses you hid in  were abandoned, wallpaper rot from the river out the door. I almost  walked into that world upside down: the broom-skirted trees, the water  clear as hair. Could I live there? Did I want to live? The cops had my diary.  I never saw that man again. If there were steps into death, I would have  taken them. But there were not steps. The houses by the river and the ones  in the woods burned. Upstairs was for couples. Downstairs: bottles  and black stubs. You slept there, but it was not safe. We played cards  and played at kissing, but it was not safe. Someone started a fire. Somebody  told. My mother and her sisters waited for the meat trucks, believing each rattle  meant escape. The missile-headed cattails. The popcorn fields.  In the woven belly of willows I am safe. In the hot air balloon basket.  In the tree house the tornado will take. In the deer beds, unmade by morning.  In the nesting of closets. In the sickest thing. In the thing I say.  In the cage of our arms, we build a safe house. No closed doors,  no locks. At home in the animals, licked bleeding or bitter.  All I know is your eyes are sweaters. All I know is slave or queen. You take on  the bees, snap an arm off a willow— and in the other hand hold  purple phlox you have picked me. Once you whipped yourself raw  to know what it felt like for me. It is snowing from the rafters. We have an audience  of pigeons. And the men will take their time.

Riding the empire builder  BY ANNA TOMLINSON    Progress makes its white way through hills chiseled out to tracks, the long history of the double-stack  bringing everything we need, everything:  listen to the night, O wise ones, sleep is coming, a woman mutters as we pass.  There is no church here but I see steeples, I see bones and burials, all that is America  in stumps and the shimmering miasma of the reservoir under the dry hills, a speed boat’s single wake  rocking the water like geese in motion, the water we all must drink, or die.  The same train that took me from Portland to Chicago when I was young: ticket to the metropolis, to follow my ancestors  back the way they came out, when passage was protected by army, treaties nullified where they found gold.  Through the window the summer sun tears the color from the wooden tray and leaves it sandy, bleached bone:  America is in these rusted spokes, white-peeling trailers. Fire in the sage brush, a mattress  propped up backward, catching flame— America, you’ll die trying. Railroad tracks and hand-ties. Some inheritance  passed from the men before me to the man in me, a singular desire that burns this land down.      Joyride  BY ANNA TOMLINSON    We sail through Iowa as if it is meant for us, our passing:  miles and miles of corn a canvas to be painted against,  Jesus thrown into relief on the brick drives, flagpoles  calling out against the radio noise. We push through rainstorms  flattened on our windshield, through six tanks of fracked gas  hauled up from dinosaurs, mastodons pressed into carbon,  turned into speed. Signs urge us to choose life. We’re sure we have:  grocery stores amazing again, Spanish olives stuffed in jars  and bright whoopie pies. At night we sit under the ruined stars  as if we still belong to their myriad pings of light.      Cradle of Silt  BY ANNA TOMLINSON    When blue rose out from the horizon & purpled into diamond, dusk,  that hour when sunslant illuminated each thin stick & fenceline, I’d walk  surefooted again to the end of the dock where the burned plank  hid a small dead fish & stare out toward the water swirling with petals  some house-boater had dumped out, roses the color of milk tinged with blood on the green  solid surface moving turgid with oil, where once they’d found a car, gone under,  mother & child caught on metal, kept from the river’s gentle carrying, the muck’s keeping—  there I’d stop & stand, the unstill part of me crawling in the skin of my jacket,  toes pressed against the single two-by-four, curled space of my body’s  lean returning & returning to this kingdom of clay, of under-water wire & roe, mess of aluminum, algae & ruin.           Anna Tomlinson grew up on Sauvie Island, Oregon. She is in her third year of the University of Virginia’s MFA program, where she teaches poetry, first year writing, and summer transition classes.

She spills out sand dunes, a city of salt for every child that could not latch onto umbilical cords.  My smile is a cesarean wound. A stitch for every sibling that did not burst from mama and cling to her bosom. for every daughter I could not be for my father. for the son I will never be.  //  When she looks at me all she sees is smoke, though she does not look at me often. Once, I am sure, she looked at my body swaddled in white fleece and wiped off of blood and said,  My God . Saw: a miracle, a torch, a burning bush telling her to bring the children to the land of milk. Cradled me to her breast and said,  Do not be afraid. You will not perish. I will be with you. My God.  //  My mom does not talk about her nine miscarriages, the lives she cultivated and felt wilt, plucked from her like pearls from an ocean bed.  I think she is too afraid to look back,  too afraid to watch the city she lived in burned,  too afraid to spill into salt.  Instead she looks through me, her brimstone child like one faces a wind,  wise of the season that has past.  //  Once I was young. This I know. Once she combed my hair.  She parted each section,  her fingers dancing through the thick, brimming.  Once she told me I would do great things. Once she said, I prayed to have my own children. Once she said, I’ll always love you.  I was her son,  dark and brimming with possibility. Once she cried and my hair thought it rain or an offering. Once she was done combing my hair, we went to church. This I know. This I have to know.  //  If the church says, Amen , it is a word.  And thus it was a word.  The reverb of a hollowing Amen  gnawed my ribs into prison bars.  What Reverend could have said instead of gay was Paper weight of the bible. Robber of the barren womb. Apocrypha.  Soon to vanish.  & what always can be said in place of faggot :  Singed Flesh.  //  Is it no surprise Sodom and Gomorrah were in the South? Along a river?  //  Needless to say, the church was in Mississippi. Needless to say, the river is full of bodies.  (We are not to forget history.) Needless to say, on a summer day, the sun can melt concrete.  Needless to say, a child, even if tucked inside a church, can melt under the weighted glare of sun .  //  I have forgotten who She is. I think her God now.  I have no holy father, only an anointed mother who can offer me salvation.  Instead of bone she broke flesh, and I am here,  a river of guilt.  A heart like Mississippi.  Full of dead brown bodies. Full of cities waiting for reckoning.  She watches me like a farmer watches rain, assessing what (damage) will be done.  //  “You know Sodom and Gomorrah burned for the desires of the flesh, boy.”  And God never looked back. Yet we drive through Mississippi as if it is holy ground.  //  Sometimes I stare in puddles, and see faceless children.  Their silhouettes inhale, and I beg them to give me back my breath,  My God!  //  “My mother,  who art in guilt.  Hallowed be thy Womb.”  I thought hallowed meant empty . I thought thy meant mine .  So forgive me of my selfishness.  I thought, Hallowed be thy name .  Meant my body was to be filled,  in the ways, by the people  who I pleased.  But again we do not pick our own names.  Again we do not own our own bodies.  Again I am sorry.  For taking the vessel of a real son away from you.  Amen .  //  For each city burnt, each child not conceived,  I offer a name. Plucked from my mom’s womb, a sea of C’s, for the real sons I am not. for the daughters I am too much like:  cecilia, cameron, carson, casey, c____, c____, c____, c_____, c_____  //  Once I burnt myself on the stove to see how hot flesh can get before melting. Needless to say, it was before church.         Kalvin Marquiz (he/they) is a Blaqueer poet and performing artist from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Untucked shirt. Knife-white bandana, shadows boxing under each drowned eye socket. There’s never been a record  of his hands, but that’s never stopped me from painting my nails. Some days we still find water jugs  in the crawlspace, already licked clean. Once I watched  someone shoot a stray dog in the parking lot.  Across one page someone has only written Before the storm  How the neighbor boy felt pressed sweating against me.  Outside the liquor store, one of my cousins took a picture  of a cross-shaped water stain.  At last this lack of landscapes.  The moon rises, then wheels, then steps  into a bathtub, slick with its own shine.  Alligators laze in red mud, hunting their tails.  Emptied lakes. A wake of widening eyes.  On the bus back to the sticks, Uncle Buck met a girl with a back-length braid who claimed she could heal the sick.  A woman wrote that god shops at the Winn-Dixie in cowboy boots & likes to click his spurs  against the carts. Bullwhips of wind.  Don’t ask me about acrylics.  Between where he happens on my tongue & a window.  Battlefielding. Bone up.  Nobody saw my grandfather  cadaver himself. Even birds no longer sound  useful. When I pray for rain I pray  the trees die before it comes.           Bradley Trumpfheller is a writer & bookseller from the South, currently living in Boston. With Nabila Lovelace, they are the co-editor of Divedapper . Their work has appeared in or is forthcoming from DIAGRAM , Colorado Review , West Branch , the Nation , and elsewhere.

It was before the first frost. Everything living had something dead to thank. Bloody November, season of beasts. The boys sneak off to the forest, smoke anything, sharpen their teeth on bedrock. We know nothing, say nothing. Whittle down to our whites at the mouth of the river. We open our legs. The first frost. Everything living is dying. White November. The mouth of the boys & whatever crawls out. We know to say nothing, whittle down, open the legs of the river. If a girl screams in the forest & no one’s around to hear, did the tree fall? Do we make a sound? Everything living is dying. White, merciless beasts. The boys sneak off, a few hours. Bone against bedrock. We wait by the river, open our mouths, whittle our tongues. A girl screams & the trees fall. Everything dying. We know the sound. When the boys crawl out of the forest dangling dead things from their teeth they scream at the river. No one’s around.

Incessant:  the baby’s cries before dark. This morning  deafened by the heron’s shrill  in the estuary it combed through, hushing  to preen its stringy neck in the fog  the moment a red-tailed hawk snatched  a hatchling from its nest.  Though I can’t remember the smell  of your cunt, I remember  other things: the way the yellowthroat washes  itself in the bird bath: the way  I watch on and will it to gag, a gentle wich-i-ty  wich-i-ty, wich-i-ty, a reminder  in song that each thing is a hunter. You  never heard the baby cry and I have  always wanted that kind of resilience.  One day my daughter will wish  she never knew me. What has this to do  with you except everyone is game?  When this day doesn’t give in to another,  when steeped into the bent kelp  reeds, the wilds, I will be spoken for, will be  swallowed up by—someone  has picked the azaleas from the grave.  NOTE:  a man imposed himself on the environment he wanted to subdue : paraphrased from curator and writer Clelia Coussonnet on Hicham Berrada’s 2015 installation Mesk-ellil at the Lyon Museum of Contemporary Art.      nightjar  BY CAITLIN ROACH    The fat sphere pinked, lowering quick into a slack mouth. I watched it dip and with everything around me nearly already dead, you were somewhere between elements, dropping through a dark you did not ask for. I photographed the ice fields, the trash strewn at the roadside, the lint on my kneecap to remember how the world appeared in those moments before you leaked into it. Four nests froze in a bald tree. The winter sucked all of its color—even the sumac spared its cardinal. In the horizon’s soft fold, azures blushed into coral, then white. You slowly gained color, the slate of each your irises darkening, the gilt wet fur keeping you whole inside it, its nautilus that must have spun on your forehead, violet as the blood settling in your nailbeds. I pictured your face yet, what would be a fullness of a nose, what your voice would soon sound like, the first let of it shocking your body the way it would the small room. Across an ocean in a room a woman sunk in a blue fixed by lunar light to reverse the cycles of night-blooming jasmine. A man sought to refit the flower’s circadian rhythms, that they might blossom at day and did. Critics called it poetic but must have meant  a man imposed himself on the environment he wanted to subdue. As you fell crows retired from lines and I mistook the sound of a thigh being scratched for talons detaching from wire as when her grip loosened when the worst of it was over, thinking of nightjars: who suck the milk of goats and so are called by that action: who at the sense of threat migrate nests and carry their chicks in their mouth: that neither of these things are true but the jasmine still are sutured to my appraisal of your onset then, wondering if you wanted any of this at all, if you doubted the faculty to breathe, were guided by meaty breasts, knew light enough to know it was dark, if in the moment you opened you were cold, could feel the space around you emptied, could see the tiles above your head and know they were blue. One day I’ll drop you just so I might bend to you and say: give me all your wounds. I will carry them by mouth, one at a time. What more can be hoped for the body anyway. Give me the hose, so from you I’ll siphon little spells.

Whatever was promised of pleasure costs the body more than it has.  Perhaps they were right putting love into books… to look at the sky without asking a question, to look at the sea and know you won’t drown today. Despite all our work, even the worst of life has a place in memory. And the fixed hours between two and five before evening are the aimless future with someone who cannot stay new. August returns us to a gap in history where our errors find the invention of a kinder regret. Almost possible: to believe these days will change more than us but the past too. Which is blue and without end. A long drive toward a remembered place. A secret left on a beach. Underwater where the voices of summer are tones of speech, requiring less of the mind. The familiar creaks in the old floorboards. Glasses left out in the storm. Our handwritten lists with every illegible worry and more. The person you think of despite their cruelty. The sun and its cruelty. How it’s kept its distance and kept us alive. Not needing to know anything about what we do with the rest of desire.           Alex Dimitrov is the author of two books of poems, Together and by Ourselves and Begging for It, and the online chapbook American Boys. He lives in New York.

The screen scabbing over me, the camera angled for entry. I hook you  like a lure. I storyboard origin: where a girl grows from god’s side wound & my mouth  mentors her pleasure. Turn down your eyes. I’ve little-spooned the moon & screwed the stars  back into my skull. Whoever said fear is a foothold has never climbed  me. Mount an axe where the sky should be. Mountains are named for their view, what you want to see  atop me. Expect to bleed today. I trade my feet for a landscape of losses:  a sea made of teeth, your nipples roaming my mouth. My thumbs wet thorns, my threefold thighs  & double-dog hunger, each barkless tree I skinned alive with my teeth. God bills me for my birth & I pay  back with my life. I’m alive now that I’m dead, I look like my mother’s mother, the one  who skipped her face like a stone across three seas, the one I receive like a bullet to the bone, my breasts blown  glass. My knock-out ass. You can’t convince me history isn’t pornography. I have a body  but nowhere to bury it. I have a harness but no horse to breed for it. What we call  tame you call talent. What you call country I call no one picking up. Tonight  my mother shipwrecks my fantasies, rains my bed into a riverbank, turns my girl back into a pyre, my body back  to a movie birth scene, false blood & stagelight, my mother calling cut  her out of m e , the camera  my father & I its foundling.      LETTER FROM MY GRANDMOTHER IN TSINGTAO  BY KRISTIN CHANG    Once in a drought, I dropped  all my children down a well to make the water rise.  Mothers always choose their own  mouths over mourning. The myth of hunger begins like this:  in Tsingtao, the German army  stole rice & millet, fed our bodies to bullets. They built  churches to keep a god & barns  to keep their women. How many girls can be stolen from  the same body? I sold  myself to a soldier for the price of a fish.  I gutted out his green eyes,  gave them back to my children. Even a fish mistakes the sea  for safety, the fisherman’s  hook for god. I raised you like a river outrunning her land. I nursed you  native to thirst & rain  outsourced from a foreign sky. I taught you to butcher  a bird & convert its bones  into perches. I taught you every woman needs  a man like a weapon  needs motive. The nation I was born in now  belongs to burning. History starts  like a housefire & I braid smoke into your hair. I once beat you  for forgetting to pray  before bed. Remember to take the lord’s name  nightly like a pill. Kneel  now & remember I knot your tongue to mine  so you never drift far  from my hunger. I alphabetize my gods by country  of origin, America always  first. Daughter, count soldiers til you sleep. One of them  will hold you by the black  of your hair. One of them will father you & the other  is your son. There is no ridding  a sheet of blood. Grieve that your eyes are green. Surrender your skin  fasting into a white flag.           K Ming Chang lives in New York,\\xa0and reads for Winter Tangerine .

I liked that even though I hate the word, female, and am not an astronaut. I didn’t bother to correct them: it’s fun for them to speculate about my life. And because it was in the context of: “If we have to, who are we going to eat first? Anna or the female astronaut?”    There are eight of us on this island: six men, Anna, and me. We were on a boat trip, we got blown out to sea, and now we’re here. My friend, Nikki, who had invited me died the morning of day three.    Maybe it was a game they were playing: fuck, marry, eat. But I don’t think so. They aren’t funny enough or interesting enough for that.    We keep all the supplies at the island’s center. Tinned sardines, a half-eaten box of crackers, two bags of turkey jerky, one large bag of dried fruit mostly papaya, five bottles of water, iodine tablets, seven tampons, a flare gun, a bottle of Emergen-C, a bottle of vodka, a bottle of good wine, four pads, Tylenol, alcohol wipes, one destroyed fishing pole, two sort of usable ones, one container of travel-size bug spray.    Died feels too gentle. Nikki drank saltwater. She was sentient fire on the last day of her life. You don’t have to be so thirsty, she kept saying to me, and tried to push saltwater in my mouth. Her father was in every cloud, giving her advice. Get yourself a 401K. Here’s the recipe for your great aunt’s greens. She threw herself, head first, into the sea. Anna had to stop me from going after her: you’ll die.    It’s been four days since then. The men mostly sit around and chew leaves, so they don’t get too hungry. In the mornings they pretend it’s grapefruit. My dad ate one every day, says one almost every morning. It was disgusting, but now I’m thirty-five and I’m exactly like him. I listen because I don’t want to think. Their voices, their conversations, are the only times where I feel bored. Where my throat doesn’t feel ready to close, where my brain can resist thinking: you should have followed Nikki.    And now, even that’s gone.    The men perform friendship rituals. Bad jokes that they goose honk and chuckle over. They talk about me and Anna, not in a sexual way, but as if we were mysteries to solve. Women are so beautiful and alien that they have to be diagrammed out, talked about in circles, puzzled over. They fish together using the least broken poles and the silence between them doesn’t seem uncomfortable.    When Nikki and I were on the boat, before the storm, we were slapped silent by the sunlight on the water, the way the air and wet made everything golden. Clouds were gathering behind us, but we were filled with relaxed silence and a mutual heart-gladness of isn’t this beautiful? We split a bento she packed. I broke the silence by laughing at how bad I was at chopsticks. My reflection doubled in her mirrored sunglasses, my lipstick so bright pink.    She had dated my sister for about six weeks, five years ago. Nikki was someone who had more gravity than most people. When you were in her orbit, you were engulfed into conversations about ghost caribou, childhood idols, shopping for button down shirts made for people who had real jugs, how tired she was of men saying you don’t seem gay, how the most unlovable things a person could say is eating crab is gross. It wasn’t just the words she said that were important. The spaces. Her semi-colons and dashes, the trailing off. The small sounds of her brain doing its most to make you feel engaged.    The men think I rarely speak because I’m grieving. But I talk to Anna when they’re not around. Even shipwrecked, we are making friends by saying things like your hair looks really good today, we offer to share our clothes to break up the routine, and to talk about which of the men we absolutely shouldn’t trust. I say none. She says just the Steves. All men are Steves to me, I say, and it’s become our one joke. The rain is being a real Steve today. Don’t Steve out on me. We can make it.    Sometimes, I look at her and wonder if we both live, will she be my new best friend? Will we tell people how we met and they’ll laugh and say, no, tell me how you really met. Will there ever be a time, where we can sit safe and in silence with plenty to eat and not feel like our skulls are on fire from panic, from hunger.    Throughout the day, I keep to myself. I look through the supplies. I listen to what the men are saying, keep an eye out to see if they are making plans. But they eat the leaves, even though it makes their mouths extra spitty. They take naps. They talk about basketball. Joke about their shipwreck diet plans. Split a can of sardines for dinner.    There is no calm for me today. I pace. And cross my arms. I go to the other side of the island with less shade. It smells of rotting fish and sea. I try to find something patient and lovely within myself. A gull lands. I gather rocks, throw them. The bird doesn’t die. I hit sand and water and driftwood.    I was a person once who would never hurt an animal even though I didn’t like the idea of a dog or cat sharing a house with me. I was someone who was annoying when she got bored. I wasn’t afraid to whine a little, suggest something else, to change conversations, pour more liquor at a party, tell a joke that I knew would upset someone or go to a bar alone. Even when trouble came, I liked the stimulation. Drama is a word for children, stimulation is the word adults use. I’m not even sure if I liked me then, but back in my old life, I didn’t have to think about it.    When everyone, even Anna, seems to be asleep, I walk to shore. I sit on the beach and let the saltwater wash over my feet. I take off my smelly jeans and t-shirt and walk into the sea. As I try to float, I am already becoming more water than person. The stars are bright. People used to say sciencey things to me about how some of the stars we’re already seeing are dead. It’s always supposed to be deep, let me tell something you might not know about the universe. And they seem almost green and for the first time in my life, they seem alive, like things that would actually listen to wishes.    I wish upon each one that a shark will tear me apart, or a jellyfish will sting me in the heart, a shell will get lodged in an artery. And I’ll sink. Below the waves, algae, down through clouds of clownfish, to the space where water becomes black. The animals there are bioluminescent and it’s warm again from steam vents. What’s left of me is torn apart and eaten, and it’s okay. I would rather it be them.     Megan Giddings is a contributing editor at Boulevard and a fiction editor at the Offing .

This is how memory works: a firing from one cortex to the next.  Two years after I left you, you were a tinny voice within a box within a box, a message that almost didn’t leave itself, the hour so odd I knew there was strategy.  You were a nothing. When you said your name, I searched my mind’s ammunition for your face.  Firing squad. Synapses.  Forgetting, an execution.  X  I want to tell the story of your guns. I search for the law in Iowa. Private residents may not possess automatic firearms. In Des Moines, you put an assault rifle in my arms and told me to shoot.  I squeezed until the gun went papa . My clavicle clacked. My arm bones rattled. Radius. Humerus.  A bullet makes a wound like a rose bloom.  As if I were watering a garden, I held on and I sprayed.  Papapapapapapapapapa.  Almost iambic.  Symmetry to a heartbeat.  You were in love with the girl I was then. When I finished, you pinched the paper target in your fingers: a flat shadow of a figure, lines and numbers measuring an inner aura.  My bullets punched away the X over the figure’s head and heart. What does it mean , I asked. You tallied the score and said, Crack shot .  I looked back at the paper, the person with their middle chewed out, the negative space spread across its entirety.  X  First-person shooter games make me nauseous. The cure, I’ve heard, is to look at the horizon.  Once, I went off in the woods with my father’s BB gun. Rifled through the dead leaves, found some fifty-year-old cans, stood them up, and knocked them over again.  Fear is the feed of gun manufacturing. A gendered fear is the most profitable: a question of when she will be a target of violence.  Who will it be?  The gun is the answer.  They make pink guns. Deep red. Royal purple. One is festooned with Mother of Pearl.  They make holsters affixed with camo print;\\xa0kiss marks are tucked with the patterns of bark and leaves.  A canister of lipstick is called a bullet.  X  I met you in August. Three weeks later, we drove to Iowa to meet your parents, and to practice at the gun range.  It was the weekend of the State Fair. I saw three gigantic pigs named Hogzilla I, II, and III.  Your mother unironically showed me your entire baby photo album. Together, you pored over effigies of your former self.  As a child, you had a translucent wisp of blond that seemed to float. An uncorrected blue gaze, eyes shiny as opals.  You were a handsome teenager, ten years before I met you.  From the kitchen, I looked into the sunken living room.  You rubbed your rifles over and over, a white cloth flagging itself against the barrel.  Your mother beamed. Such a clean boy.  Do you see me?    An arsenal is three or more guns. You had eleven.  They were kept in the basement on their own wire scaffolding shelf.  I let you fuck me on that stone-colored carpeting with the disembodied parts of the rifle spread next to us.  X  Somewhere, this year, a cop tells a room full of trainees You will never have sex as good as just after you’ve killed a man.  This job comes with few perks.  Take what you can get.  Somewhere, this year, a woman enters a store and asks to buy a gun for self-defense. We can’t sell you a gun , the man behind the counter says, but we can sell you a rifle.  For hunting.  The AR-15 assault rifle and its variants have been used in every American mass shooting since Columbine. You put this gun in my arms and told me to shoot.  It was easy to love. From my hands sprung a rapid swarm of bullets humming like bees. The injection port pumping.  Inside me, a pumping to match.  X  In Chicago, you kept a Colt .22 in a square platinum case under your bed. I was sitting above it when you said I love you. Then, I know you love me too.  I replied with nothing.  This was the same nothing I give to men who shout down my ass from across the street.  It took us sixteen hours total to drive to and from Des Moines. You picked the music the entire time. When you were in the driver’s seat of my Honda, riding up against the back bumper of the car in front of us, blaring on the horn, I remember thinking I was about to die. In the lane next to us, the driver of a semi stared down at me, scowling, inching his hubcaps toward my door.  Nothing but empty plains, cottonwoods bursting with leaves, and night around us.  X  On our first date, we sat on the roof of the autoshop next door to your flat. We sipped grenades of Mickey’s. While solving the pictograms in the bottlecaps, we were interrupted by the faint bursts of explosions echoing from a nearby alley.  That one’s a firecracker, you said.  That one’s a gunshot .    The night my best friend, Erick, raped me, I had told him I planned to break up with you. I told him about the Iowa trip, how you expected me to say love , how I forced myself to smile so often it felt like I was cracking my teeth against a heavy stone.  He kissed my cheek and told me he loved me only hours before violating my body in the dark.  I should have told him about the gun range. My crack shot.  I often have dreams of killing Erick in public. I strip him naked. Call him rapist . Shame him for his fat, round back.  People watch. Sometimes they try to stop me and fail.  I take his skull in my hands and smash it against whatever surface is closest: the edge of a table, a concrete curb.  My fingers pull tighter around his curls, squishing between the widening pangea of his fragmented skull.  The morning after the rape, I called you. You took me to the hospital but stayed in the waiting room. You said you had a fear of hospitals.  You said, If I had been there, I might have fought him.  Might meaning maybe.  X  What came next was a series of no ’s you pushed back against.  X  Once, you fucked my placid body until I sobbed.  X  Once, I asked you to stop touching me and you refused.  X  Once, I told you I planned to kill myself and you started crying.  X  I stayed with you, somehow.  X  I needed another bed.  X  While you slept next to me, the wretchedness I felt made me think of the semi-automatic underneath us, pillowed by soft dark sponges in its platinum case.  X  This was the first gun you introduced to me at the range. The most important for me to know. For protection.  X  It was the loudest gun.  X  It hurt my hands.  X  Each shot spat hot soot onto my fingers.  X  Some of the bullets made the wood around the target frizz.  X  Most landed in the paper figure’s middle. Shred the carbon to oblivion.  X  Brain.

SONG BENEATH THE CITY  BY MICAH DEAN HICKS    For decades, the four plumbers had answered the call of old widows who’d dropped jewelry down their drains. Sometimes, the plumbers unscrewed the U-shaped trap under the sink, knocked out its splat of tobacco-colored crud, and fished out a golden ring. But other times, there was no reclaiming the lost diamonds and gold. They tumbled blind through the maze of pipes below the city, never to see the sun again.  Whenever the plumbers left a house, the widows would ask, “Do you hear it too? The singing that comes rattling up from the pipes?”  The question made them uncomfortable. They knew pipes, their rust and fittings, their wet metal smell and black oozings. But in all their years, they had never heard a pipe sing, only gurgle or wetly retch.  The plumbers kept an index of everything that had been lost down the drain: coins, diamonds, earrings, rings by the hundreds, bullets promised for enemies, the occasional tooth. By the plumbers’ tally, millions of dollars had made their way through the pipes, slowly tumbling down through the earth to the lowest reaches of the city. They planned for years, looking at maps of the city sewer system, touring its waste treatment systems, making secret forays into subterranean construction sites. The city had been burned down and rebuilt in layers, and centuries of pipe were linked together beneath. Who could say how deep the water fell? They decided to find out.  The plumbers attired themselves like astronauts. They wore headlamps, breathing masks, rubber boots and gloves. They brought compasses, Chinese dictionaries, football pads. One of the plumbers, not knowing how long they would be gone, brought a winter coat.  “It will be like another planet,” one said. “There will be dangers. Curtains of black mold that colonize the lungs. Pockets of burning gas. Fields of shit writhing with rats. Snotty orbs of fungus. To fall will be to die.”  “And what of the creatures?” said another. “The blind scum gators? The drain snakes? The metal-mouthed centipedes?”  “And the people,” said another. “Every sad, angry, abandoned person, carried down here by the rain while no one noticed.”  “We can’t even imagine what it will be,” said the fourth and youngest plumber. “It will defy our every expectation.”  They followed the subway rails, snapped open a locked tunnel with bolt cutters, and ventured into the dark. The sounds of the city—honking and shouting, laugh of water tumbling from faucets, roar of thousands of flushing toilets—faded until they could hear only their alternating heartbeats. They listened to their four hearts, and their hearts said, want, want, want, hope .  The older three chuckled at the fourth’s naive, hopeful heart.  Beneath an ancient and abandoned wastewater treatment plant, they found huge sewage tunnels that ran through the city like bones. The plumbers broke open a rusty access door and climbed inside, the black water flowing hot and thick around their legs. The smell made them choke, and the darkness here was thicker than any they had ever seen. They dropped into it, following the tunnels down, down, down, to the very bottom where every heavy thing came to rest.  The pipe opened into a natural cavern. There was light here, and their eyes stung. Not the murky yellow of city lights, or the sharp blade of office lights, but sunlight, warm and red as blood. How it got there, under miles of earth and pipe and water, the plumbers did not know, but they imagined it too had tumbled down the drains in small golden pieces, until it piled here.  Out of the light and dense black soil, trees grew, pressing against the high roof of the cavern and curling along its rounded celling. Leaves and flowers fell into a clear pool in the middle of the cave. The plumbers heard a low, sad singing echoing over the water. This was the song the widows had told them about, and the plumbers realized it had always been with them, faint under the ringing of their hammers and the scrape of their pliers.  In the pool, four mermaids with silver scales swam and sang. They were laden with gold and silver. Had rings on every finger, bracelets up their arms, their ears pierced sixteen times. Their long, black hair was heavy, plaited with diamonds and gold. The plumbers’ four hearts pounded, want, want, want, hope .  “How did you get here?” one of the plumbers asked.  “There was once a channel that flowed under the city from the sea,” a mermaid said. “We swam here looking for treasure when we were young. But the people above drilled and poured concrete, and the tunnel closed behind us.”  “Can you take us back to the sea?” one of the mermaids asked. “We miss the open water.”  “Of course,” said one of the plumbers, promising too quickly and smiling at the others. “Of course we will.”  Each of the men hoisted a gold-heavy mermaid from the water, careful not to bruise her tail, and carried her out of the cavern.  “I told you,” the youngest plumber said. “It defied our every expectation.”  “We expected treasure,” said one of the others, “and treasure is what we found.”  As they climbed through the earth, the noises of the city became louder. Honking cars, crying children, the lip-tripping speed of advertisements, and the patter of lie upon lie falling.  “That doesn’t sound like the ocean,” said one of the mermaids, her hair rattling with gold. “It’s very close,” said one of the plumbers. “I can almost hear it.”  They carried the mermaids into the gray city above. There was no water here, only dry brick and concrete, heat rising from the asphalt. The plumbers each took a mermaid back to his apartment, ten stories above the ground, and put her in his bathtub.  “Where are my sisters? Where is the sea?”  The plumbers brought them telephones to call their sisters and cans of chopped tuna. They opened their windows so the mermaids could see the city far below, and then the plumbers sat down on their toilets to stare at the mermaids’ naked, captive beauty.  “When will we go to the ocean?” asked each of the mermaids, every day, as days turned into weeks.  “Tomorrow. If the weather is good,” said each of the plumbers, every day, as months turned into years.  * * *  The plumbers sold the mermaids’ jewelry, quitting their jobs and shutting themselves away in their bathrooms. They were mesmerized by silver scales, seaweed-dark hair, luminescent yellow eyes like lamps burning under the water. The three older plumbers climbed into the bath and sat behind the mermaids, plaiting their hair and massaging their slick skin with rough, hairy hands. The mermaids’ long tails hung out of the tub, their fins growing brittle in the air. The plumbers kissed their necks and ran their hands over their scales, and the mermaids sang their sad song.  When three of the mermaids gave birth to daughters—babies with slim legs, webbed fingers and toes, the same dark hair and glowing eyes—the plumbers asked, “Do you love me yet?”  The mermaids answered, “If I said yes, would you let me go?”  The youngest plumber did not touch the mermaid he had brought home. Rarely did he speak with her. He would go into the bathroom to pee, and turning to her, he would ask, “Do you need anything?”  “Let me and my sisters go,” she would say.  The young plumber explained that he was trying, but the older plumbers didn’t want to give the mermaids up, no matter what he said. “What can I do?” he asked.  “Go away,” she told him. “That would be the very least.”  For years, he cleaned himself with a washcloth at the kitchen sink. At night, he lay in his bed and listened to the mermaid, on the phone with her sisters all night, singing in the small bathroom, her voice rising in one long sob.  * * *  There was a storm. Rain and ocean surge covered the streets with water, and the radio told people to stay inside. The old widows called the plumbers, complaining that water was backing up into their sinks, filling their basements, flooding their lawns. The plumbers said, “We’re out of the business. Call someone else.”  The four mermaids hauled themselves up to the small window and watched the city fill with water until asphalt vanished and the buildings rose like spars of island or reef. The mermaids wept and called one another. “Can you see it?” they asked. “The sea has come.”  Their daughters peered down at the water through their mothers’ thick hair. It was like the sky had come down to meet the earth, everything open and wide. They felt their mothers’ longing for space.  “If you jumped, you would die,” the three older plumbers said, their arms like chains around the mermaids’ waists.  In his apartment, the youngest plumber could see that the mermaid was preparing to jump, to throw her body down ten stories into a few inches of water. She would die and become only a memory, like the sea in her mind.  “It isn’t deep enough,” he told her. “Not yet.”  She looked at him for a long time, and the plumber felt small and ugly under her eyes. Finally, she said, “There is something you can do for me.”  The plumber took the elevator down, fought the wind and water in the parking lot to get to his truck, and found a rusted pipe wrench and hammer. He drove through the flooded streets in his tall truck, breaking fire hydrants open one by one all the way from the ocean to the apartment building. The hydrants opened their red mouths and spewed free the city’s water.  The four mermaids watched the water rising and whispered to each other on their phones. Their children ran over the bathroom tile, slender and quick as fish, begging to go play in the storm.  “No one is going outside,” the plumbers said. “Without you, what would we be? Only plumbers.”  When the fourth plumber came back up, the mermaid said into the phone receiver, “Now.”  They turned to the plumbers, opened their arms, and said, “I’m afraid.”  The four plumbers rushed into their arms, their slippery soft skin, the damp hair lying over their shoulders. The youngest plumber cried into his mermaid’s hair, telling her that he was sorry. Their hearts throbbed, want, want, want, hope.  The four mermaids flicked their muscular tails and flung themselves from their windows, carrying the plumbers with them. They fell through the open sky, spreading their arms and straightening their spines like they hadn’t in years. This was what swimming in the sea felt like. The water rushed up to meet them, and they turned their faces to it.  The eight of them crashed into the water, the plumbers clinging to the mermaids. Three of the plumbers pulled the mermaids’ hair and climbed their shoulders, fighting to get up for air. The mermaids rolled in the water, pressing the plumbers’ hairy faces to the wet road, holding them beneath the water until they were filled with it.  The mermaids’ daughters dropped down from the sky, knifing through the water with their tiny bodies and grinning at the lightning flashing across their faces. The current swept them down the street, and they linked hands so that they wouldn’t lose one another.  The youngest plumber fell with his mermaid and went limp with sorrow. She held him close under the water, looking at him with her lantern eyes and bringing him just to the edge of drowning. His heart sent its message through the water, and she heard it for the first time. Angry and sad at all the years he’d taken from her, the mermaid shoved him away. With dolphin leaps, she flew down the street to join her sisters, rushing into the arms of the ocean.  The youngest plumber was swept against a tree, the wind battering him. He shouted through the storm for the mermaid to come back, but she was gone, and his voice was small against rain and wind. Looking for her silver tail, her river of hair, he saw instead the mermaids’ daughters clasping their webbed hands struggling in the current. Before he could reach them, the girls were swept into a storm drain, vanishing through the pipes and falling toward the bottom of the city.  The last plumber turned away from the chortling thunder. He let the current push him into the sewers with every other lost thing. He went deep into the dark, pushing through mud and shit and rats, calling out for the lost girls. But the city was big, the pipes roared loud, and he didn’t know any of their names.  * * *  For years, a group of old widows had listened to singing echo up through their pipes. They held phone receivers to their sink drains, asking each other, “Do you hear it?” And when the widows dialed up their hearing aids, they could.  They’d called plumbers, hoping to understand, but the plumbers told them that there was no song beneath the city. Unable to stand the mystery any longer, they raided their closets for flashlight and batteries, worn hiking boots, their dead husbands’ walking canes. They put on their strongest prescription eyeglasses and went into the sewers, blushing at No Trespassing signs and pressing forward.  After a long time, they reached the bottom of the city. Here, they found a grove of trees in a sunlit cavern. It was fall, and the trees had turned a bloody orange, their leaves covering a deep pool. In the pool, three young girls swam and splashed, kicking their finned legs. On the bank, a bearded and filth-covered man slept near them.  “Is it you?” a widow said. “Singing the sad song that echoes through our pipes?”  The girls shook their heads. “Sorry. We don’t sing. But the plumber does. Every night, the same sad song.”  The widows nodded and sat on the grass. “That’s too bad. We had hoped it was our husbands’ ghosts, singing their love for us.”  They watched the sunlight in the cavern dim. The girls grew quiet, and the plumber stirred, rising on the bank and blinking his rheumy eyes. The widows turned up their hearing aids and listened, waiting to have their hearts broken again.

B the businessman and C the economist and D the poet—and smaller stories too, minor loves, Y the novelist and X the scholar and W the activist and V the painter, they all come back and I am the biggest regret of their lives. I was the love of their life that they let get away. Anywhere from thirty-eight to eighteen years ago.  In the meantime they had families. They had wives, they had children, they had furniture they bought and jobs that progressed and soccer teams they coached.  In the meantime I waited. I sat here in my wooden house in my wooden chair and I looked out my wood-framed window at the wooden swing hanging from the tree in my front yard and I thought: Please. Just one of you, any one of you, please change your mind and turn around and please come back to me.  My loves, I will give anything.  Anything, I used to think. I would have given up my arm, my house, my heating. I would have groveled at their feet or tithed to their church. I would have had no sex or sex every hour, I would have fought off armies, I would have lost my name, if just one of them came back in time for the life I’d wanted, which was simple, and unambitious, and looked like my parents’ lives: a life where somebody cooks dinner for somebody else. A life where, if no one buys groceries, it’s some kind of failure. A life where, your train’s delayed two hours, it’s someone’s job to pick you up. A life where, someone’s flying cross-country, your stomach never settles until they’re on the ground again. A life where you’re praying the whole time they’re in the air. A life where when the wheels lift off you think, if you come home to me again then I will thank my God and bless those wings and love I will give anything.  Just one of them. I’d been willing to become the woman I would have been with any of the seven—different women all, and all different from who I became, which is a woman unformed, staring out a window, watching my swing rot year by year. With B I’d have become playful, with C quiet, with D unstoppered; with Y edgy, X snobbish, W poor, with V addicted. Each of them had their perks and their downfalls. With B and C I’d have lived in a house we owned in the suburbs, with a finished basement and two cars we drove and one that just sat in the driveway; with D and W and V I’d have lived in a city apartment complex that was half public housing; with X and Y I’d have traveled, I’d have rented, I’d have been always going somewhere new.  For twenty years I was ready. I would have lived any of those lives. I would have packed my bags or planted gardens. I would have straddled their waist or been tied to their bedpost. I would have frozen in Chicago or burned in Miami. I would have gone camping in the woods or skiing in a chateau. I would have cooked every meal or put takeout on speed dial.  In all worlds I’d have stayed Jewish, and a daughter, and a writer. I’d have sung showtunes in the car and in the shower. That’s it. Those were the only constants I required to remain identifiably myself.  They never came. I lived in a rented one-story house on the far edge of a city, I traveled rarely and for one day at a time, I waited and waited and my heart became harder and my life became smaller and I looked out that window hopeful every morning and I looked out that window hopeless every night and sometimes I grimaced and sometimes I doubled over and one day I noticed that I never went outside. Out the window was a porch and a set of stairs that no one climbed, and beyond that a swing on a stretch of grass that ended in a fence I couldn’t see. My singing sounded strange to my own ears.  And now: here they are, at last, at my doorstep. Now:  “Here we are,” they say. “You are our great missed chance. We didn’t know it, but we’ve missed you all our lives. Somewhere in the pit of us we have been always screaming.”  Several, seeing me, wipe tears. They are old now, they are bald in ways I anticipated and ways I didn’t, in aggregate I love them more than it is possible to love, I want to check all their foreheads for fever. The ones I’d expect to be holding flowers are holding flowers; the ones I’d expect to be empty-handed are empty-handed; D of course has a book wrapped in newspaper, V a small canvas he painted himself. In aggregate they are my most intimate body of knowledge.  Yet the longer I stare at them, filling my stairway, the more in aggregate I am sadder than it is possible to be sad, because if only from this gray-headed mass a single one had peeled off like a rogue grape from a cluster then my whole life would have been set. I’d have been a person too, like them, instead of a stiffening window-gazing wasted lump of wood. I’d have loved them. Each one, for different reasons and in different ways. For B and Y I would have learned Spanish, for C Urdu, for W Hebrew, for V art history and for D black history and for X history of western thought. D and V and Y would have had tattoos, X would have had psoriasis, B would have had strong calves from soccer, W and C strong arms from squash. D would be dry, B wet, V an alcoholic. X would have stayed skin-and-bones even as the rest of them grew paunches. With C and W I’d have had laughing kids who loved their grandparents, with B and Y kids who hated them, with D kids who looked down on them. With V and X, no children. B and Y and V would have protected me, walking down dark alleyways, B with an arm around my shoulder, Y always half a step ahead, V with a knife in his pocket; X and W and C I’d have protected. D, whom I’d loved best—for him I would have killed.  Do you understand , I want to ask them, what it is to wait?  But I know they don’t. They have been busy. They have had wives to buy groceries for and children to put onto airplanes and airplanes to will safely across continents. They have lived in cities and countries and Chicago and Miami and places I never thought to imagine, probably, Chile and South Africa and the town where I grew up.  I do not let them in. I open the window and lean out. The wooden frame is hard in the flesh of my stomach.  “Well,” I say, “which of you is it?”  They murmur to themselves. A bouquet gets dropped and picked up again.  “It’s all of us,” says B.  “All of you.”  “All of us or none,” he clarifies.  He had always been the one to set the rules the way he wanted.  I think of what it would be to have all of them. How we would fit in my bed. The sex had been different with each one: with B absent, C formal, Y slow, X awkward, W sweet, V rough. With D alone it felt like making love.  “And how,” I call, “would you expect to get along?”  Murmuring, again. Such bafflement before me, always, on the part my boys. My men. I look into the mass of them on my porch. In all these years I’ve tried to fill in what has happened to them. B and C had office lives already fully formed, clear-pathed; D and V were strivers, the artists were strivers of course, their lives hard to picture, but so was X the scholar and so in his way was W the activist; Y though a writer had little ambition, seemed likely to go farther than the others anyway because he was handsomer, somewhere within himself he was sure of this. I try to verify.\\xa0 Who looks shabby, who looks neat; who looks healthy, who looks sick.\\xa0 They all look low, dissatisfied.\\xa0 On every face a look of hunger.  “We would get along,” says B, “in honor of you.”  “Of missing you,” says C.  “Of loving you,” says D.  Then yes, say the words in my heart. Come in. What are you waiting for?  “And how would you repent?” I say.  They each left me in their different ways: B never felt attracted to me, D felt too attracted to me, W had a girlfriend, C had a wife, V lived far away, Y was busy and X wasn’t ready. Maybe , they all said, to the last. Maybe someday.  So I waited. So as not to hate them, I remembered: B was my best friend. D was my best art-partner. Y was best looking, X the best listener, C was smartest, W kindest, V was saddest. So as to still say yes when they came back, I forgot: the way their backs looked. The sound of the car door closing. The precise way each one said the word goodbye.  They move up toward my front door.  “My loves,” I say. “I have to think.”  They’d each have hurt me in their different ways. B never would have compromised, with him I could have cheered on Messi’s millionth goal and still if I asked him to come to a play he would have said it’s boring baby go alone; with C if I wanted a purple quilt for our bedroom and his mother wanted yellow I’d have slept in marigold duvets until I died; with D I would never have had him completely, he would go away to readings and there he would bat his eyelashes and miss his train and girls like I was would fall in love like I did and he would not say no. The minor loves, too, would have found their way toward harm. With Y there would have been comments sometimes, about the unmarked whiteness of my skin or that my parents had paid for my college or that I always fed the parking meter; with V I would have known every last detail of his college girlfriend, I could have spotted her from the middle of Times Square, would see her face repeated endlessly in his portraits; with X I’d have watched him watching how large a slice of cake I cut for my plate; with W even on vacations we had saved for he would have snuck into his briefcase yet another petition he just had to read tonight.  Still. Even still. Even knowing what I know I’ve lived my whole life waiting for a single one to look behind him and say, Oops.  They rattle my doorknob. They strain the bolt. It’s clear they believe I’m still human. I’d thought so too, with my everyday waiting, but now in the face of them all I understand I’ve become something else. I try to tell them: Do you know what so much unused hoping does to you? It drives you crazy. It burrows into your heart and rots you like a piece of wood. It coils in the pit of you and it is always howling. It breaks you like a toaster is broken. Not pain. Function. You don’t work anymore. You hiss and spark except when you are cold. Inside yourself you have spent a lifetime on your knees.  Yes , say the words in my heart. Come in. What are you waiting for?  “Go away,” say the words in my mouth. “Go home.”  “We have pulled down our homes for you,” they say. “We have left our wives. We’ve wrecked our lives. You want us to come back. We’re here.”  “So come back thirty-eight to eighteen years ago,” I say. “Not now.”  Within my heart I have welcomed them in, I have taken their coats, I have found enough vases and enough chairs and enough cups for the water or wine or coffee or tea or beer or juice or whiskey each will want, I have let them pet me, I have let them cry, I have found a way to stack them lengthwise pillow to footboard and sleep horizontally across each one, I have kissed B’s forehead and D’s lips and C’s neck and Y’s chest and X’s navel and W’s hip and V’s thigh. Within my heart I’ve woken up.  Outside my heart, I say: “If you can swing me on that swing then yes.”  They turn around. They look at the scene I have been watching by myself through the window from the time I was twenty, then thirty, then forty and fifty and up and up. The green grass. The wooden swing. The fence beyond I cannot see.  “Courtney,” says W, “the swing is gone.”  It’s true the wood gave way a decade earlier.  “Courtney,” says X, “where is the tree?”  It’s true the great oak fell last spring.  “Courtney,” says Y, “where is the rope?”  There was a flood. Three years ago, or thirty.  “Didn’t one of you bring rope?” I say. “Aren’t any of you trees?”  “Maybe we can make a swing,” says V.  I let them look around. I let them see the nothing I have seen. I say, “From what?”  *  The minor loves go seeking. But the major loves stay on.  B, C, D: the funniest, the smartest, the dearest. They knew me best; they hurt me most.  “You never wanted to go to the park,” says B.  “You were afraid of heights,” says C.  “You didn’t like to swing,” says D.  “Of course I did,” I tell them all. “Of course I did.”  *  The minor loves return. They haven’t found anything. My rules are firm. They have to go. I watch them: I remember what I have made myself forget, so that I could say yes to them on an impossible longed-for day precisely like this one: the look of their backs. The sound of the car door closing. The precise way each one says the word goodbye.  I settle into my seat by the window. I am comfortable here. I will go back to the task of forgetting. I will go back to missing them forever, forever wishing please. Just one of you, any one of you, please change your mind and turn around and please come back to me. Forever thinking love, I will give anything.  It’s V who comes back.  V a minor love, the painter with whom I would have been an addict, the saddest. The one, therefore, I might have loved the best, with time. He’d been a little schmaltzy. He’d held my hand across tables, studied my knuckles like they reminded him of some sea-thing tossed out in a bottle years ago, pressed his lips to the knob at the back of my wrist. He’d been the most recent, the last. He is striding toward my front porch, holding his little canvas under his arm.  “Listen,” I say, “I’m sorry, I can’t make an exception, what will the others—”  He doesn’t climb the stairs. He walks right up to the window, leans inside, and pulls me out.  He is not gentle about it. His canvas falls, facedown, on the back are pencil sketches of heads that look like mine. I get a splinter in my side. He doesn’t seem to care. I have not touched any of my loves today, major or minor; to touch him is a furnace.  He has me in a fireman’s hold. I twist my neck and see the revelation on his face.  “You can tell,” I murmur. “I’m not human anymore.”  He nods.  “You’ve turned to wood,” he says.  It’s D who comes back next, and with him I am afraid to touch, I pull away, I press myself into V’s shoulder, I can’t help it, but my majorest love puts a hand on my hand and like a dead man’s reflex I hold back.  Each of them takes a piece of me. They turn me faceup in their arms. V and X support my knees, Y and W my hips, B and C my shoulder blades. D cradles my head in both hands, like an egg. I am held, I am touched, I can feel each one like a lover in our bed. They start to rock me. Slowly at first. Back and forth and back they rock. I watch their faces, I see each one as he’d have been as a father over a crib. They move out to my extremities, Y and W take me by the ankles, B and C by the wrists, they are men pushing a grandchild at the playground, they are swinging harder now, higher and higher, their faces are blurry, sick and old, I can’t tell whether they intend to let me go or rock me, please, just one short second longer.

FROM “SLEEPSWIM”  BY SARAH FENG    Runner-Up for the 2018 Adroit Prize for Prose Selected by Rachel Heng  After Aldous Huxley  Around this time, Yvonne X starts to slip. I’m not complaining. She’s gaudy and unoriginal, and I’ve had enough of her. (She wears knock-off necklaces for their thrifty aesthetic, even though her 40 minutes on the Stream probably earned her enough to buy a dozen houses. She even smokes her pixie dust like another rapper from Hour 4—looping the crumbly shoestrings into an infinity symbol. Tacky. Copying’s just about the cheapest way to go.)  Still, I take meticulous notes on her and graph the curve of her Stream engagement data. She rose fast: 27 seconds on the up-and-coming, and then straight to the upper echelons of the Stream. That’s passing the three-billion-threshold in 27 seconds. You do the math. The public liked it.  On her current livestream, where she and her boyfriend are smoking in a recording studio, her viewer count ticks down six thousand.  To be honest, I’m relieved to be done monitoring her. I leave her page to find someone more relevant.    5:31  While I let the week’s up-and-coming videos babble away on my wall projection, I sift through queries in my inbox. The most recent ones include a violinist who started a foundation for other violinists, a radical feminist, and a slew of indie dessert stores with ice cream rolled into physics-defying styles.  The violinist gets deleted. The public only cares so much at a time, and there is already a community service kid right now. Then I delete the ones about food and the ones about workout products. To successfully weed out submissions, you have to realize that the Stream has no room for excess.  While scrolling through, I pause on the email of a graffiti artist. Her art samples are good: bright, galactic spreads of spray paint on walls. Her sample video is good: a skinny, freckled Chinese girl saying how she wants to destigmatize street art, how it’s her form of expression, and explaining the hierarchy behind the graffiti community.  The pF—phenomenon factor—is high enough; I find the information about the community fresh, which means the public would too. It’s worth looking into. I can gamble on something like this.  I call her, wait for the fuzzy static of the line connecting. It comes. “Renaissance Consulting speaking. Is this”—I pause, glance down at the name of the sender—“Elliot Zhang?”  “Yes.”  “Ms. Zhang, I believe your Stream profile has potential.” And on, and on. “Would you be available for a quick interview so we can determine whether you’re a suitable client for our services?”    5:34  “I’m Elliot,” she says, “as you most likely already know.”  “Right,” I say, shaking her hand. “Theodore Newark, from Renaissance. It’s nice to meet you.” I can feel callouses on her fingers, maybe from pressing on the sharp ridges of nozzles.  It took me three minutes to get to Lower Alta when it should’ve been two and a half. There was a pedant-rights protest in the Tick station, and my bag was jostled off my shoulder, costing me the 5:32:30 ride. I’m late—and to our first meeting. Embarrassing.  I apologize, and she tells me she doesn’t mind, she understands. We sit down, and I flick on my recording device. “Let’s start off with stating your name and background.”  “I’m Elliot. I’m a graffiti artist. I like re-defining art and the way it works. There’s a common misconception about street art, how it’s for delinquents,” she says, softly.  In-format answer. “What’s your favorite subject matter to depict, and why?”  “The resilience of humanity.”  She’ll have to go deeper than that.  It must have shown on my face, because she begins adding more details. The graffiti community. Living in Lower Alta itself, the stigma surrounding it.  “That’s good, thank you,” I say. Elliot bites her lip. “Can you show me some more of your art samples and talk me through them?”  She pushes her tongue into her cheek, now. She’s going to need to slim down her repertoire of idiosyncrasies—she just bit her lip. “Sure. I have photos of them. I’ll go grab them.” She disappears into her room.    5:36  While waiting at the table, I hear Lina Trostyukov’s distinctive voice bobbing from somewhere in the house. I follow it, peer through the narrow slit of a doorway.  A short woman is watching the window-television above the sink, rhythmically applying layers of jelly to bread. She’s compact, hardened, like Elliot, her hair coarse grey wires.  “… What? Too scared to kiss me ? ” taunts Lina on the window-television screen, her hair whipping around her latex mask.  Lina is a classic actress, like the ones that adults laugh about over wine and poker, from two days ago. In this movie, she acts a superhero who’s fallen in love with the villain. But this particular story is original, because one of them isn’t white, and the background visuals are better than its predecessor’s.  Elliot’s mother relaxes under the leathery hum of Lina’s voice. I relax, too.  I’ve worked on movie sets before; I know the real reason Lina sounds so good is because of audio-smoothing technology that manipulates her sound waves to release serotonin in the audience. It makes your eyes half-lidded, your mind one-tracked.  A gutting scrape sounds. Elliot’s mother bends down, tries to pick up the knife she dropped. Her fingers sag and scrabble against it.  Awkwardly, using only the muscles in her palms, she scoops white pills from her pocket and downs them. Some slip through and clatter to the ground.  Pill bottles are a trademark of self-prescription, which means she knows what disease she has. The public would consider her a pedant. She’s part of the old generation who attended physical school and worked to become an in-person human doctor. Now the Azalea Education Code allots every child over the age of 12 one (1) rudimentary EdUSB to be inserted into the surgically-fitted mesh in the nape of the neck. I wonder which route Elliot’s mother chose for her daughter.  In a few moments, Elliot’s mother is able to spread her fingers. She reaches into a cabinet and carefully re-stocks her pockets.  Then she returns to her work, sliding the knife back into the thick black jelly, Lina still crooning above her. I feel invasive. I look away.    5:41  When Elliot returns with a fistful of low-res photos, I look for the flash of metal in the skin underneath her ponytail, of her EdUSB port. It’s there.  While I look at her art samples, just to fill the time, my phone pings with an approval message from the aesthetics department, which determines whether someone’s objectively beautiful enough to make it on the Stream. It’s a 92% match to previous Chinese Stream entrants.  I set the photos down. “I just have a few more questions for you, and then we’ll be good to go.”  “Ask away.”  I can’t tell if her earnestness was part of her act, or if it was really her. Though there isn’t much of a difference between the two nowadays. “What are your biggest challenges?” I ask.  “Family,” answers Elliot. “My mother’s a pedant, my father’s janitorial staff. Low income.”  “Pedant mother,” I say, as if surprised. “Really. How might you respond to those who question whether or not you’ve been influenced by the often elitist worldview of the pedant class?”  “I haven’t.” She pauses and fixes what she thinks is her mistake, watching my face. “I love my mother, but I am my own person. I’m heavily influenced her in all other aspects, but I am someone who forms her own life philosophies.”  She draws a breath, ready to continue, gauging my reaction, my silence.  “That’ll be enough,” I say. “Thank you for your time.”  Elliot sits back. She makes her nervousness show. “Really? Have you made your decision already?”  “No.”  She pauses. “When will I be notified of your decision, then?”  “In—thirty seconds.”  Closes her mouth, still staring.  If she was plunged into the shallow, faceless waters of the Stream world right now, she would know what to say. Maybe blindly, like everyone else, a tadpole pushing against the soft slime of its membrane. Who knows. The possibility of the alternative is what makes me want to sign her.  I fish out a contract from my briefcase and slide it across the table to her.    5:45  There is a Japanese woman with marigolds coming out of her hairline. Our videography team examines the alley wall. Under the woman’s neck lies a fat slab of garbage.  Elliot re-sprays a her hair while the videographer jerks the camera up and down, shifting the focus in and out, while our actors hiss, swear, clink glass cans of beer. The edited video looks tastefully shitty. It’s exactly what the public wants.  A few seconds after we upload it, Elliot’s on the up-and-coming page. They like her badass, they like her graffiti flower punk, they like her pastel soft swan disadvantaged emo. Her mother also keels over that minute.    5:49  Our agency’s van drives Elliot and her unconscious mother to the hospital. When we get there, a flurry of white-clad nurses spirit Elliot’s mother inside, trading medical diagnoses over the gurney. Her disease is acting up, and it isn’t the first time, according to Elliot.  As the rest of my videography team turns to drive back home, I stay. Elliot and I walk to the waiting room. “How are you feeling?” I ask her.  “I could be better,” she says.  “You really are something,” I say.  “Yeah.” She flashes a smile and then lets it slide off her face.  I calculate, briefly. I could touch her cheek right now. I could coldly storm out and let her chase after me. I could lay my hand over hers, like a tender, shy schoolboy. There are multiple ways I could carry on this cheap romantic subplot. It’s how I’d test if she realized what we had all become.    5:52  We spend too long in the hospital. Elliot had a real shot at getting on the Stream. I gambled right. It was the unexpected occasion of her mother’s medical activity that cost us the time necessary.  In the waiting room, a girl comes up to Elliot and asks for her autograph. She’d seen Elliot on the up-and-coming. Elliot signs her notepad with a quick flourish and grins.  After the girl leaves, I tell Elliot she’s going to drop.  “Why?” she says. “I thought I was doing well.”  She’s either still acting like she’s in front of a camera or she’s just naïve. “I’m sorry, Elliot. It’s the Stream.”  She sighs like she’s trying to fit as much air into her mouth at once. “Damn. I wanted to get my family a better house.”  I wince. Public cameras in the corners of the rooms are still swiveled towards the two of us, but I know they’re trained on me, not her.    5:55  I do it then, as we’re standing by the hospital’s sole vending machine. She bends down and grabs the bag of chips she bought. She’s talking about how she knows her mother will make it through.  When she stands up, I kiss her. Elliot steps back, and she looks like she actually believed it, and that’s how I know it didn’t work.  I knew you would do this, you’re the Stream consulting agent who makes a move on all the girls, she says, you’re in the tabloids every day, how could you betray me like this. (and on, and on.)  A stiff crinkle of aluminum bag in her palm. She is flustered and convinced that I like her.  She thinks: rich Stream consultant boy in love with his poor girl client. This story is original, though, because one of us is not white.  “I can’t do this, Theodore,” she says. My mind’s already running permutations of the possible things she’d say, the selections from the script that we follow.  I consider telling her but decide against it. It would be cruel. While driving home, I masochistically flick my radio station to the Stream.    6:00  They try to make the Hourly flush subtle. Now the radio blasts about the breakup of the Jyrion family and Lina Trostyukov’s old costar, Dimitri. The pixie-addict rapper from last Hour has been replaced by a Korean immigrant named Hanla, giving commentary about the notes of aged Orwellian alcohol in some slab of meat. Then a Lower Altan political scandal, and then Theodore Newark lost and doesn’t know his role in the grand scheme of things. That’s fair. I have to give them that. The real meat of the Stream is the visuals, which are programmed to be projected ahead of me in the windshield. Looking at them makes me sick, but it’s my job.  My tears, embryonically stubborn, don’t want to be straightforward. Elliot is texting me, maybe trying to give me a second chance.  The car lurches to a stop. I get out, never wonder where the car came from, and stare at my office building, trying to recall where exactly the entrance is.  The ambiguity is one of the pitfalls of Upper Altan architecture. All of these pixie steel buildings roll and curve, one single optical illusion that makes you feel like you’re always moving so fast, all the time. Really, you’re probably just kicking in your sleep.           Sarah Feng is a junior from Northern California and the managing editor of COUNTERCLOCK  Journal .

Bug Murder  BY POLINA SOLOVYEVA  Winner of the 2018 Adroit Prize for Prose Selected by Rachel Heng  When Lena was seven she sat on the kitchen counter and asked her mother if they believed in God. Her mother did not hear the question so Lena kicked her in the stomach, listened joyfully to the sound that its insides made. Her mother said what do you mean we and don’t kick me again! In response Lena dangled her bare feet. The sunset outside turned everything around them into gold. Lena said she meant their family, her mother frowned and said probably, went back to cutting carrots. Lena’s throat made a funny choking noise and suddenly felt too narrow. In silence she watched her mother’s sharp movements, wondered what it would feel like to be diced. Suffocated by the sunlit kitchen Lena felt herself a ghost spread into the dark peachness of the sky.  In Lena’s Bible for children there were many pictures. She really liked the Saints but Joseph scared her everything about him was lonely even the donkey. Lena imagined him placid and in awe of Mary’s wrists, not a man but a dissolution. At night he pressed his head into Mary’s neck and barely breathed. When she was not there he imagined every single one of her fingers in detail, dreamed of biting each of her nails. In the kitchen that afternoon Lena likened herself to Joseph, fought the temptation to tenderly lick her mother’s hands. Instead she watched her sharpness. Let’s set the table her mother said Lena jumped off the counter, marvelled at the coldness of the floor. She held a stack of plates in her arms and squeezed them in what she thought to be both spilled out anger and intense pleasure. Carrying the plates to the table she talked to them and assigned them names: Martha, Millie, Michelle, Maria, Maggie, Mia. She loved Millie the most but dropped her, couldn’t understand if she did it on purpose or not. Her mother sent her upstairs with a voice that was an empty crack reminiscent of sound. In her room Lena stood on her knees and thought about Joseph.  The dinner was to celebrate Lena’s grandfather. He was going away to the hospital but promised to bring back many toys like stethoscopes and reflex hammers and tongue depressors. Lena specifically asked for a crutch and her grandfather promised to steal one if he had to, winked right into her face as if he understood it all: Joseph, mother’s hands, the dissolution into the sunset. He was the only person who knew about Lena’s hate notebook together they despised the barbie on its cover. In the moments of overwhelming fury Lena sat down at her desk and wrote all of it out. There it was:  MY SISTER’S HANDS SMELL LIKE CABBAGE or  MY FATHER SAID HE LIKES TO SEE MY MOTHER NAKED or  EVERY MORNING MY GRANDMOTHER CRIES  On one of the pages she drew Joseph with his donkey and then scratched both of their eyes out. When her grandfather found her hate notebook he laughed until he cried until he groaned. The cancer in his stomach flipped and pushed, he sat down with Lena in his lap and closed his eyes in what they both thought to be a retraction. Lena knew that he was going to die soon but did not know if that was good or bad. In the Bible they talked about heaven there it was all beautiful white clouds.  During dinner they talked about LOVE that was big sad and monstrous. Lena’s sister laughed her father did too her grandmother went to the bathroom six times, came back with her eyes all red. Her mother’s carrots made Lena’s throat feel sticky, in anger she whispered filthy words at them. Her grandfather couldn’t eat just sat and stared. Lena didn’t know much about LOVE but everyone talked about it including Jesus so once she sat down on the bathroom floor and hugged herself but felt nothing, only a pimple on her shoulder. She tried to hug other people too but did not fit into anyone else’s body: her sister was too short, her mother’s breasts touched her face. When she hugged her grandfather her ear became a part of his belly button somehow it all fit. Lena wondered if that was LOVE but she was not sure, all she knew was that it made her want to squeeze his body until everything inside of it came out as a wonderful sticky mass. Together they would make it into lumps and throw them around as if they were snowballs. Thinking about it Lena giggled everyone looked at her her grandfather smiled with the corners of his mouth. When they ran out of ketchup Lena’s mother fought with Lena’s father over it. He was supposed to buy more but forgot, Lena’s mother said per usual! she said how can you not keep such easy things in your head! she said I asked you for one small thing! Lena’s grandfather said guys don’t worry ketchup causes cancer anyway! then went to the bathroom. When he came back everyone was quiet only Lena was laughing.  When the dinner was over it was time for Lena’s sister to go to bed. Lena thought it was better with her gone. She never cared much for her sister only for furniture like chairs and sofas and bathtubs. When Lena was leaving for a summer camp a few months ago she made sure to hug every single curtain with what she hoped to be big sad and monstrous LOVE. Pressing the fabric against her body Lena confessed her affection with words of foolish tenderness. Afterwards she became friends with a trash can. She checked on the new trash every evening said hello to the ugliest banana peels so that they wouldn’t feel lonely decomposing. Lena wanted to remove loneliness from all things made sure that all of her dolls were sitting together kissed all of her trash before bedtime when no one saw. In her bed she slept on both of her pillows woke up in the middle of the night and switched the bottom one to the top. Whenever she had food Lena made sure to finish all of it felt bad for the leftovers touched the last pieces lovingly with the tip of her tongue. In these tender moments a strange wave of violence overwhelmed her, made her want to bite her grandfather’s wrists but softly. Thinking of loneliness made Lena’s insides twist and swirl during these moments she always thought of Joseph, wondered if he wanted to have Jesus in the first place. In her mind he did not want to share Mary with anyone longed for an exclusive privilege of kissing her knees. Sometimes Lena imagined Joseph and his donkey talking to each other during sunrises, no Mary around only the two of them sitting on the ground. Joseph would complain about the bitterness of his shattering, his donkey would bray. When Lena told her grandfather about it he said HM! Then he painted a small picture of them at sunrise and put it under Lena’s pillow.  While everyone was cleaning up after dinner (washing plates, not mentioning ketchup) Lena went to the basement to see her insects. She collected bugs of different kinds pretended that they were her babies took them on morning walks. The way the bugs looked when they died made her heart hurt so she didn’t bury them but put them into a huge jar and kept them there in a pile until they started to rot. Lena wanted to feel LOVE like this for people but was too clumsy about it. When her mother tried to take the jar away Lena bit her index finger until it bled and then she bit it some more. When all of her bugs died Lena sang them a funeral song petted their boneless backs tried to close their tiny eyes. Then she put all of them into the lasagna that her mother was making, could barely contain giggles while doing it. The next day she watched her father try eating it and laughed until she drooled. When he asked her why she did that Lena said because bugs don’t cause cancer daddy!  Her grandfather found her in the basement and watched the bugs with her for a little. Lena showed him Tommy the bug with just one wing he was happy all three of them were. Lena told her grandfather about the bug lasagna and the lonely banana peels he frowned but not in anger together they watched Tommy trying to fly. Then Lena asked her grandfather if they believed in God he said do you mean our family she said no just you and me. Her grandfather kept watching Tommy and watched and watched and then he said yes we do. Lena felt the room around them shrinking. In the dusty condensed space that was them she wanted to squeeze herself into her grandfather’s skin, turn into a birthmark. She said will you go to heaven from the hospital can you come back to bring some toys her grandfather said anything you want Lena said okay thank you. For some reason Tommy stopped trying to fly Lena’s grandfather said that he must be really tired. They laid down on the floor together and breathed. Lena said will you travel between here and heaven her grandfather did not respond only stared. She took Tommy out of his jar and squeezed him until he became one disgusting bloody mass, then she put him on her grandpa’s cheek. Like this they breathed some more.  The next morning she went to the river with her grandmother barely talked only crawled on all fours and smiled with the corners of her mouth. Her grandmother told her to act like a girl not an animal in response Lena showed all of her teeth, made a clacking noise. They laid down on the grass and watched the clouds move everything around them was still. Her grandmother sang. Lena made growling noises, chewed some flowers. She thought she remembered how she went down to this river with her grandfather grilled sausages and splashed water but her grandmother told her it never happened. Lena thought maybe it was a dream but in her dreams she mostly flew. Her grandmother kept singing Lena started to bite her toenails. Suddenly she felt like Joseph so lonely and old only without a donkey.  On their way home Lena’s grandmother held Lena’s hand, ignored her attempts to squeeze and scratch. Lena felt like she was losing all of her words, couldn’t get her tongue to move the right way. She watched the sky around them swirl and point, her grandmother murmured a song but did not feel attached to her own mouth. When they got home Lena searched for her grandfather tried to locate his smell in the house. When she realized that he was not there she ran around more and knocked on walls, checked in every single closet. Her mother and grandmother watched in silence Lena said is he already gone her mother nodded. Together they all stood in the kitchen then Lena crawled under the table. There she turned herself into detached body parts two arms two legs no substance in between. A pile of messy bones she suddenly started wanting to sing. Her mother joined her under the table and said I am sorry we did not let you see him off but it is just easier this way. Together they sat there. With her back against the wall Lena’s mother pretended to be a rock in that moment Lena was a rock too. Her grandmother started to make lunch. Through the ceiling Lena thought she saw her grandfather riding a cloud like a horse. She went into the kitchen and started kicking the trash can until it broke and spilled all of its nastiness on the floor. Her grandmother waved her arms at her in an ambiguous gesture her mother was still a rock. Lena went upstairs opened her hate notebook drew her grandfather in heaven smiling and scratched his stomach out.

I love how it’s full of personal detail but by enacting this relatable catalogue of “medical history” it becomes universal. This poem also has me thinking about facts and what they can and can’t offer. Would you talk a little about the last line, how the speaker says, “I understand, / the stars in the sky are already dead” and this is corrected in your end notes? How did you decide to embrace this falsehood and also let readers in on it by having that note at the end?  Nicole Sealey: “medical history” is all about (if a poem can be “about” anything) what we know, what we think we know and what we have yet to discover. “I understand,” I believe, speaks to this. Though the line does not tell an actual truth, it does tell a poetic one—one that reiterates the tone and sentiment of the poem. Plus, poems owe nothing to truth. Though, I must admit, I believe that I owe it to readers to provide scientific truth. Hence, the note at the collection’s end clarifying that stars are most likely not dead. That the distance between the stars and us is so great that we can only see the brightest stars.  I guess one can argue that I embrace both falsehood and reality.  KW: And when did you know this would be the first poem?  NS: I don’t remember the exact moment in which I knew , but the collection itself called for an opening poem void of pretense. Part of the pleasure I take in writing poetry is an instant intimacy with readers. By the first page, we’re practically family . As we know, the relationship between reader and writer is reciprocal. We bring with us all that we are, the sum total of our experiences up to that point. There’s an exchange happening—one that encourages vulnerability, one that can transform strangers into kin. Which is why the opening poem is one of my most intimate poems, which is why I was so comfortable opening the collection with “medical history,” its lines: “I’ve been pregnant. I’ve had sex with a man / who’s had sex with men. I can’t sleep.”  KW: I love this idea of bringing all that we are as writers and also as readers. Is this “instant intimacy” something you look for in collections you read as well? Does something you’ve read spring to mind?  NS: I definitely look for “instant intimacy” in the collections I read. I look for heart and sentiment.  As a reader, I want to feel. However, I don’t want to be told when and what to feel. Poems by poets who write against sentimentality often end up lacking sentiment altogether. Whereas sentimentality is contrived, designed to elicit a specific response at a specific time—the cued music on a television show that tells the audience when to clap or cry, sentiment is real feeling. Poets like Lucille Clifton , Vievee Francis , Brigit Pegeen Kelly , Sharon Olds , and Matthew Olzmann write poems with heart and gut. Everything these poets have written comes to mind.  KW: On the subject of the real and unreal, I’m drawn to your use of the hypothetical in this book, especially in “ the first person who will live to be a hundred and fifty years old has already been born ,” in which mother and daughter discuss immortality and their different conceptions of time. I’m thinking about how you use the hypothetical to provide this beautiful distance from which to consider what is. How do you think about this alternate world-building in poetry or any writing and what it can offer?  NS: I truly believe that poetry is drawn from the collective and colored by the individual. Though we have immediate access to images provided by personal experience, such as the time and place in which we exist and the circumstances into which we were born, the I , by virtue of its humanness, is the we . Whether we know it or not, we access a history much older than ourselves and geographies beyond ourselves. That said, “beautiful distance” is natural. This distance , I think, is in all poems, including “the first person who will live to be a hundred and fifty years old has already been born” and “ in defense of ‘candelabra with head .’” Distance gives us the opportunity to see ourselves objectively.  KW: Another way this book engages possibility is via revision or addendum. I’m thinking of “clue” and its erasue “c ue” and also “candelabra with heads” and “in defense of candelabra with heads.” Can you talk about engaging these coexisting paths through the same material?  NS: Yes, revision and addendum and addition. Just because a poem is “finished,” doesn’t mean the conversation is over—poems are ongoing conversations about what it means to be human. For example, I remember neither what I was thinking nor reading when I drafted “medical history.” I do know that it was conceived on the heels of “the first person who will live to be a hundred and fifty years old has already been born.” But, I believe, all poems work in this way: one poem leads to another, and that poem leads to another poem and so on and so forth. In this way, we have no choice but to engage coexisting paths through the same material.  Also, I’m not sure if the “same material” remains the same . With each reading and re-reading, the material is as changed as we are.  KW: Your “ cento for the night i said ‘i love you’ ” perhaps comes at this idea of retooling from another angle, offering a new path through both an incredibly significant but common phrase, “I love you,” and also through the lines of so many other writers and thinkers that are filtered together here. I read elsewhere this poem took quite a long time to write, but it’s also very patient on the page to me as a reader. Can you talk about the white space and why you chose to break the different sections across pages?  NS: White space is an important part of “cento,” of any poem. White space indicates points at which readers are encouraged to take a breath, to take it all in.  As I’ve said, a poem, by default, accesses times and spaces beyond itself. “cento for the night i said, ‘i love you,’” however, intentionally set out to do just that. Because of this, the poem required more room to breathe, to stretch out, hence the double spacing and the sections.  KW: Would you share a little about how you go about titles as well? I’m thinking about “Imagine Sisyphus Happy” and the way it contextualizes the poem that follows. Where do titles come in the process for you, or does it vary, and how do you think about their work in relation to the rest of the poem?  NS: At the CantoMundo retreat last summer, Rigoberto González said that a poem’s title is actually the poem’s first line, which I wholeheartedly agreed (and still agree) with. And, like any first line, a title ought to be compelling. As you know, a title isn’t garnish, it is doing the revelatory work of contextualizing and situating the poem within larger conversations. In the case of “Imagine Sisyphus Happy,” the larger conversations include love, pity and the absurdity of life.  Though every poem requires something different of its title, for me, titling is an important part of the poem making process—as important as the image, as the line, as voice and style, as revision. As such, I spend as much time on the title as anything else.  KW: I noticed in your interview with Kyla Marshell for Mosaic Magazine that you mentioned adding love to that famous list of certainties normally composed of just “death and taxes.” I’m fascinated by this and how hopeful it is, but also how you discuss the way love and death are intertwined. Your book would suggest to me this is a hopeful thought, but I thought I’d ask you to expand. If love and death are intertwined, where does hope fit? What are your thoughts on hope and poetry, or hope in poetry?  NS: Hope , I think, is inextricably linked to love and death. So, too, is it linked to poetry. I’d even argue that poetry is hope. Hope , as Webster defines it is: “to cherish a desire with anticipation” or “to want something to happen or be true.” I often attribute that or a similar description to poems as well.  KW: I’m tempted to end there because that’s such a powerful sentiment, and it really brings into focus what’s so precious about poetry, so thank you for that. Perhaps it works though, to leave our discussion of poetry there and conclude by asking about other art forms. Do you practice other arts aside from writing? If you could be a virtuouso of something else what would it be? And is there a piece or an artist of that form you admire that you could recommend to us?  NS: I’m a fan of art in the most expansive sense and of beautiful things in general. Like most people, I love music, theater, dance, visual art, literature , et cetera. When I was a kid, I wanted to be a ballerina. As a teenager, a singer —I sang in the gospel choir. And, how could I forget interior design (I recently reupholstered my dining room chairs) and fashion (I love pairing classic and unconventional pieces together)? Basically, I’d want to be a virtuoso at everything! If there were more hours in a day, I would seriously pursue all my passions, not just the writing.  At present, I’m still awestruck by Deborah Dancy , whose 2016 work, Queen Bea , is the jacket art for Ordinary Beast .  Back to Issue Twenty-Six .

Links  FAQ                      Interview   August 30, 2018   The cause to remain open: A Conversation with Colin Winnette   by  Reid Kurkerewicz               0     Photo credit — Jennifer Yin  Colin Winnette is the author of several books, including Haints Stay (Two Dollar Radio) and The Job of the Wasp (Soft Skull Press). He lives in San Francisco.  ***  Reid Kurkerewicz: You mentioned once after a reading that you appreciated your particular MFA program because you were able to work alongside artists in many different mediums. Can you expand on what that experience did for your writing.  Colin Winnette: I was in writing workshops during undergrad and went on to study at an interdisciplinary graduate program. In general, that meant I went from studying with a small group of people all working in the same medium (which was extremely helpful and inspiring in certain ways, especially when starting out), to an enormous group of people trying to do a lot of different things all at once (which opened a lot of mental blocks and re-framed my thinking as a developing writer). I learned a lot about craft in the workshops and about writing itself, but studying fiction in an art context helped me better understand the ways in which writing fiction was an act of making art, and could be thought about as such. Every element in the production and presentation of a piece of writing can be looked at as an artistic decision, to be engaged with in ways that alter the meaning of the work itself. That helped me better understand that there aren’t rules for fiction, but there are things that people have done for a reason, or to achieve a desired effect (conscious or unconscious). That might be obvious to some, but for me it was an important distinction that was reinforced in graduate school. It helped me because it created a sense of freedom that was based in decision making.  RK: The Job of the Wasp seems to take place outside of identifiable time, and objects that would date the historic period are conspicuously absent. In particular, I get the sense that you avoid communication technologies, even as you grapple with issues surrounding the gathering and processing of information. In Haints Stay , especially, but also in The Job of the Wasp , information seems to float around unmitigated by technology, yet confusion abounds. Why do you leave out the machines we usually blame for our problems?  CW: Contemporary communication technologies aren’t used or described in those novels, but I wouldn’t say they’re absent from them. Haints Stay and The Job of the Wasp are very different books, though. The Job of the Wasp required an isolated narrator and a setting that was difficult if not impossible to place in time. Haints Stay is set in a different world altogether—one that refracts our own, sitting somewhere between reality and dream. It uses that setting to engage with ideas about masculinity, identity, and violence, and problems I think pre-date modern communication technologies, but remain pressing issues. My favorite novels do this: explore something urgent by looking at it aslant, or even looking away from it or obscuring it (see Moby Dick writing about America, religion, and humanity by taking to sea on an isolated ship, or Marie Ndiaye’s My Heart Hemmed In , in which you never learn the specific reasons for the narrator’s persecution, only that she, and people like her, are viewed with contempt by the members of her community). But I don’t make a point of avoiding modern communication technologies. You’ll see them in other things I’ve written. I think with an iPhone, as with any other element in a story, the question is how to write about it or write around it in an artful way. It’s in there (or out) if that decision adds to the meaning and experience of the work itself. That’s all that matters to me.  RK: The danger in the idea that truth is partially personal is that it can obscure the obviously harmful actions of those who intentionally operate in that moral grey area, like a Henry Kissinger or the bullies in The Job of the Wasp . The narrator himself begins to take actions knowing that others will have their own unique understanding of the current situation. If we accept that truth won’t stay in one place, how does one go about setting up a system of morals? Is a moral compass even possible in the world of The Job of the Wasp ?  CW: Every system is limited in scope, so when it comes to the question of how to treat other people, I try to listen and respond to the person and the situation itself rather than apply a system. I don’t always succeed, and this isn’t always a sensible approach, so sometimes I hate myself. But a lot of the problems in The Job of the Wasp come from the rigid application of a system of thought onto a situation in which not everything is known (or the manipulation of well-intentioned systems by potentially corrupt individuals). I’m as skeptical of that rigid application as I am of anyone who says there is no truth, so who cares what we do. Growing up in Texas, I was steeped in morality, surrounded by very moral people, and they were some of the most close-minded and hateful people you could ever meet. In some cases. Others were spectacularly generous and beautiful. I love them to this day, will always love them, and consider them role models. A system of morals is only as good as the person using it to get by.  RK: There seems to be distance between the reader and the characters in your novels. Even as we come to know them, important aspects of their identities are withheld. The most obvious example, to me, is the narrator’s unknown name in The Job of the Wasp but extends to more complicated facets of identity like religious belief or the entirety of your character’s pasts. Do you know the answers to some, or all, of these questions, or are they hidden from you too? What’s an example of something you don’t know about the narrator in The Job of the Wasp ?  CW: I know the answers to certain questions, and there are others I still wonder about. But, for example, I tried to fully understand the physical setting, although it’s obscured in the book itself. As for the narrator, if there’s anything I can’t say for certain, it’s what happens to him next.  RK: Another reason it is difficult to get to know your characters is because you continually traumatize them, and we often catch them in the middle of readjustment to a harsh world. How do you go about evoking these readjustments without having experienced them yourself? (I assume you haven’t dug up too many corpses.)  CW: A book is its own world, complicated and clashing, and that world is (significantly) a work of the imagination (h/t: Patty Yumi Cottrell for this phrase). When writing, I try to let whatever happens happen, just to see what’s there, what’s possible. When revising, I try to look at the terms the novel is setting up for itself, the decisions I’ve made (consciously or unconsciously that are working together in a way that feels meaningful). I do my best to engage with those decisions when describing what a character is going through, thinking, feeling, saying. One of the ways a book comes to feel unique and true, and therefore alive, is by thoroughly and consistently engaging with its own terms. But this book isn’t inviting you to step into the skin of a boy who has uncovered a corpse, and live what that must be like, because I don’t think that is a singular experience. The world of this book is absurd, surreal, scary, and sincere. Everything that happens is shaped by those characteristics.  This question touches something at the heart of this book, though. The Job of the Wasp is very skeptical of our ability to perceive or communicate what is happening with another person, or what they’re going through, thinking, or feeling, and why. If anything, it’s about the terror of detecting the distance between the life that surrounds us and our limited ability to perceive and respond to it. I have these limited tools and this narrow psychology, and yet I am impacted daily by external forces that exceed those things and demand some kind of response. It’s a beautiful part of living, the cause to remain open and changing and growing, but it can also be terrifying and difficult. Enter this horror novel, in which the narrator urgently and obsessively tries to understand what is happening to him, and why, so that he might come up with some kind of proper response to it. To me, that can be what it feels like to be alive.  I would be skeptical of any book that claimed to be a 100% accurate depiction of a specific experience—which isn’t to say one’s experience doesn’t matter. Every individual brings something unique and important to their work, and as such, experience gives one an incredibly valuable set of resources from which to draw on. The more books written and published and celebrated by writers with different backgrounds, the more we’re able to see, and the more ways we have of seeing. This is one of the many reasons diversity in publishing is essential.  RK: Your work seems to be in direct conversation with worlds we usually think of as cinematic, like horror movies and westerns. Conversely, what non-narrative artworks inspire you?  CW: The paintings of Agnes Martin .  Back to Issue Twenty-Six .

Links  FAQ                      Interview   August 30, 2018   At the altar of creative thinking: A Conversation with Dorothea Lasky   by  Lauren R. Korn               0      Dorothea Lasky is the author of five books of poetry, most recently, Milk (Wave Books, 2018), as well as ROME (W.W. Norton/Liveright, 2014) and Thunderbird, Black Life, AWE , all out from Wave Books. She is the co-editor of Open the Door: How to Excite Young People About Poetry (McSweeney’s, 2013) and several chapbooks, including Snakes (Tungsten Press, 2018) and Poetry is Not a Project (Ugly Duckling Presse, 2010). Currently, she is an Associate Professor of Poetry at Columbia University’s School of the Arts, where she co-directs Columbia Artist/Teachers and is the Director of Undergraduate Studies. She lives in New York City.  ***  Do not deny, Do not deny, thing out of thing. Do not deny in the new vanity The old, original dust. — Laura Riding, from “Incarnations”  Lauren R. Korn: There’s a repetition in Milk that, I think, mirrors both your subject matter—the persistence of [making] a human life, a baby—but also that of the writing process: repetition until inception, as it were. Do you see these repetitions as being similar? I’m curious, too, as to whether Milk has always been a collection of poems, or whether the book has been, at any point in your writing process, a single long poem. (Again, I’m speaking to the collection’s recurring images.)  Dorothea Lasky: Thank you for noticing all of these things. The book was never one long poem, but I did mean for the repetition in the book to suggest a kind of cohesive, one long poem feel, but I did also want the book to feel like a set of discrete poems. Like so many other poets lately, I have been thinking a lot about the connections between the essay form and the form of a poem. In earlier versions of the book, I had essays included alongside the poems, but then decided to take them out, something I feel now was the right decision. However, I think the book has elements of the essay in its type of repetition. It comes back to ideas, imagery, and language as a way to emphasize them. The book has an iterative structure, versus a trajectory of progressing anywhere in particular. I’ve always been somewhat against the idea that poems have to have arguments and I think the more books I write, the more my poems mirror this belief. As in making anything (babies or poems), the process of creativity is about coming back to something you’ve technically “done before” and seeing if you can do it again, perhaps better, or at least in a new or different way.  LRK: At certain moments in Milk , I was reminded of Ariana Reines’ Mercury —both books see women’s bodies held up against technology, the subsequent perception of those bodies through technology’s lens, but also in spite of it; there is, too, the idea of poems holding or being spiritual objects; and I think both collections speak to a kind of modern romanticism and lyricism. How do you view poetry as a part of or being the core of your spirituality (if, indeed, you hold such a belief)?  DL: Thank you so much of comparing Milk to Mercury . I love the similarities you have found between them and would love to think more about them. I do think of poetry as a core of my spiritual belief, in so much as in anything, poetry is a way to record everyday life and make it important. The last few months I have been thinking a lot about the purpose of a life and the point of art making, and feeling very sad and hopeless as I circle around these ideas, particularly as the cruelties of the world and humanity rise more and more to the surface. I think of course that ideas of purpose or the point are distractions for living and for spirituality, and for poetry, too. I guess that in so much that poetry is like any human process, it is spiritual. I think poetry can transform and transcend, but it doesn’t have to. In this way, I hold Poetry up like a god.  LRK: Another aesthetic similarity I see between Milk and Mercury is their use of illustrations between sections. Is visual art a regular part of your creative practice? How do you see your illustrations pursuing clarity—or obscurity—in Milk ?  DL: I am very much a frustrated visual artist with zero talent or skill. This manifests in my everyday life in terms of fashion, as I am a somewhat obsessive collector of costume jewelry. I would say that the visual world — and my experience of it — is at least of equal importance to poetry to me, if not more important. When I was working on Milk, I wanted to work a bit against the idea of typical section breaks in contemporary books, which again suggest some sort of linear progression, as when they use Roman numerals and suggest an ordering of elements. I thought that having images versus words or numbers might help me find my own way of organizing the book, so I created my own images that felt like they represented the book and its sections. The images are meant to give the book an occult element, as I feel that the visual world is tied closely with the possibility of another world, with our literal vision obscuring other alternative ones. I drew the images with inspiration from sacred symbols, ideas of weather and atmosphere, and other divinatory materials. It was my hope that Milk might look a little bit like a spellbook.  LRK: How has motherhood changed your relationships to or with other women ? Do you see that change reflected in Milk and/or your current poetics?  DL: Thank you for linking this conversation between Rachel Zucker and Sarah Manguso. I have a vague memory of hearing about it many years ago (I see it came out in 2009), but I don’t think I ever read it in full or much of it at all until now. It’s quite amazing to read it and think about what parts of it I relate to now and then what parts I do not. It reminds me a bit of a conversation I had with Sheila Heti, right before her book Motherhood came out and right before Milk was released this spring, which was just recently published by Propeller Magazine and can be found here . Except that conversation felt very different, both the experience of having it and the air which surrounded it, and seemed to feel much more about our books specifically than us as people and the choices we’ve made in our own lives. That conversation felt wildly intimate for a brief time, despite us never having actually met, and I sincerely can say it was a great moment in my life to talk to someone as magical and brilliant as Sheila Heti about her book, a moment of communion for me.  That being said, I don’t think Milk has changed my relationship with other women. Not that it is the same thing, but I don’t think that being a mother has either, maybe sadly. I don’t have a lot of close friends, female or otherwise, and motherhood itself has isolated me further into a solitary path where I feel I have less and less people to talk to or hang out with, which feels extra lonely as it feels like it could be an opportunity for things not to be this way, as motherhood has definitely made me a more loving person. Or least my perception makes me feel so, for whatever that’s worth. I do long for more conversations with people and for more real friends.  But then again, here I am talking about real life and Milk is not real. I think if anything my current poetics has maybe nothing to do with other women. But then when I say that it seems ridiculous as the book itself is absolutely for other mothers, so that they wouldn’t feel lonely if motherhood was not exactly what they were told it would be. It certainly wasn’t for me, as my first baby was born three months early and as her life hung in the balance, I searched for poetry books to help me through it. Milk is meant to be a gesture of love for mothers who need it — who need a poetry book that is a friend during a hard time — for them to get their power back. It’s meant to be an offering, which is what I’d like my poetics to always be.  LRK: Milk seems to be, at many points in its pages, in conversation with or utilizing confessional poetry, acting as record(s) of your cognitive space (even though so much of your poetic imagery reflects exterior space). What is your relationship to confessional poetry?  DL: I guess I would say that I love confessional poetry, but not necessarily the term confessional. Or more so, my associations with it, which involves a sense of misogyny. I feel that the frame of confessionalism is always somehow saying it is un-poetic to discuss the self in a poem, when I feel all poems involve the self as a lived-in necessity. I think poems involve the self and the body, as the two are so deeply intertwined in a poet, alongside all of the outside forces interacting with these two things. But I think that the main argument I have with the term confessionalism is again that having a self and all its messes in a poem is essentially unearthing a taboo. A self itself isn’t ever a taboo—it’s just that some readers want to read about certain selves more than others. But no, I do think the self and the body are one thing, in a poem and in everything. And because they are one thing, they become simply portents for the poem to hang on to.  LRK: Your collection, Black Life , bears the epigraph “NO MILK / BLACK LIFE,” which you attribute to Laura Solomon . Upon reading Milk , this epigraph sprang to mind. Do you see these two collections—and the collections that make up your oveure , broadly—speaking to one another?  DL: I love you for noticing this—thank you! They are meant to absolutely be in conversation with each other, as Black Life , is about nihilism and the annihilism of self that happens with death, when there is no milk left to give that can save you. It was written as my father was dying from Alzheimer’s and during that time, I was thinking a lot about what parts of our selves exist beyond this lifetime.  I stole the quotation to start the book, as around that time, Laura Solomon and another artist were playing a game where they gave people those two lines and asked them to think about what they first imagined when they heard them. Then I think the idea was to create something out of whatever one thought of first. At least that’s how I heard the prompt. When I did this exercise, in my imagination, I immediately saw a mother and son, in a room bathed in green light, with an empty Milk container. The boy’s smile is sinister and directed at the viewer. He knows that life can be ruthless and that death is mean.  When I had my daughter, because she was a preemie, right after she was born I needed to pump breast milk to help her start to live outside of my body. I remember the nurse coming up to my room right after I had her and taking down tiny drops of colostrum to the NICU, as that was all it was going to take to jumpstart her tiny body. I saw the power I always had, but never knew I had, to save a life. It was in these moments that I remembered Laura Solomon’s line, “No Milk,” and immediately saw milk as a sort of symbol for the lifeforce, for the power of creativity.  I see all of my books in conversation with each other. I put poems in each of them that reference the other ones in various ways. As a poet, I see my life as the writing of one long book .  LRK: How has publishing changed your relationship to poetry? Do you see that change reflected in Milk ?  DL: Although my first book, AWE, came out about 11 years ago now, I still continue to feel grateful to have people who publish my work. It was difficult getting my first book published, as I had entered every first book contest ever for years before Wave Books published it. There was a sort of rigidity and reticence, I think, that my poems developed in response to this, as I really did feel that my work was being judged coldly and ruthlessly constantly, like being on a perpetual first date with poetry readers. But once AWE was published, I started to let my guard down a bit and I think my voice changed from there. I saw the intimacy and depth of care that existed between me and real living readers, and my love for them poured out into my poems. I see Milk as being a sort of pinnacle of this love.  LRK:  Milk is strewn with color. I know the cloth edition of Milk is green, but I’m curious: do you consider green the color of the book? (I think I would say the book is blue.) If I were to ask you about the tonal color of the book, would you have a different answer? (I think I would say the book is orange, tonally.)  DL: I love this question! Yes, I do think of the book as green, actually. I know I mentioned the green light in my Black Life image earlier. The strangeness of green has long been an obsession of mine. I think even close to 20 years ago, or maybe even longer, I started thinking about how much green can change a poem or a picture and how this relates to common ideas of green, that it represents health and renewal. I think of plants as holy things and related to life-giving, which relates to Milk ’s theme as well. But although I instinctively trust that plants are “good things” they aren’t always and they are actually very odd and represent the weirdness of being alive in the world. Anyway, I’d say the green I think that is the book is related to all of these ideas and is the green of the cloth edition of it. I love that you think the book is blue and would love to hear more why you think so. The color it is tonally is especially a very interesting question. Tonally, I might say it is yellow ochre, which I guess in many ways is close to orange. I’d love to ask this question of other books sometime and discuss it with you.  LRK: Ha, I would love to do that, too!  My next questions are my attempts to ask you questions you may (read: probably definitely) have answered at some point in your life, but which I’m hoping you haven’t answered in an interview capacity. (Thanks, Jack Spicer.)  Write about how the fall of Rome affected modern poetry.  DL: Do you mean modern poetry, as in Modernism or contemporary poetry? I feel like the fall of Rome has affected nearly everything about contemporary culture, either maybe or definitely unfortunately. The idea of Rome is a cloud that absolutely informs life in America. I think the myth of Ancient Rome itself shapes American poetry immensely, not by the use of its imagery, which can be oppressive and silly when used incorrectly, but in its syntax and relationship to the power dynamic between the persona and the reader.  LRK: How do you see that power dynamic playing itself out?  DL: There is something definitely frightening but potentially exhilarating about the way power displays itself in American English. The kind of speech and writing we are taught in schools here and the kind of syntax we favor is heavily simplistic, stylized, and staccato. Our syntax is militaristic and the language of Ancient Rome was too, just in its own way. Of course, I do feel any sense of grammar and all its formalities is possibly militaristic in any language, but I hesitate to make a generalization like that because I am (obviously, ha) not a linguist. I think the idea of grammar itself is violent, as it seeks to control new language. That’s why poets are so important, because we resist this violence with the beauty of our creations.  LRK: You’re probably hating the commas I’m adding to your responses. Always in copy-edit mode… Sorry!  DL: No, thank you! I hate punctuation in general, except maybe a sexy colon making a title all formal-looking or a period piercing the air. I think I may have taken at least one of your commas out already.  LRK: Ha. Good. I tend to over-punctuate, anyway. …What constellation do you most resemble?  DL: Probably most people who know me would say Andromeda, but I wish they’d say Draco. The truth is probably Volans. What about you?  LRK: Today, I feel like I most resemble Cygnus. It’s always looked like a shrugging torso to me, like the shrugging emoji or emoticon. Not to say I’m ambivalent or uncaring. I’m willing to admit ignorance. All of this has little to do with its mythology, but… Why do you say you most truly resemble Volans?  DL: Because I’m wily. I love yours!  LRK: Ha, thank you. I’m interested in the story of Leucippus and my etymological namesake, Daphne: my interpretation is kind of a stretch, but I guess I identify with a want to resist stasis. I feel, too, that I’m loyal, which seems like a kind of stasis, actually.  DL: It makes sense! Also, I can see why you think of loyalty and stasis as being connected. It definitely feels that way to stick by someone or something, no matter what. But I think of loyalty as something so positive, and stasis has a depressing tone to it. Perhaps I think of loyalty as a choice.  LRK: Good point. I guess the stasis I attempt to resist is that of identity. I listened recently to an interview with the writer Jesse Ball , who said, “I think it’s much more pleasurable…to go through life dynamically altering who you are and how you feel about things.”  DL: I love this idea and I totally agree with it. Just as Dickinson said, “We both believe, and disbelieve a hundred times an hour, which keeps believing nimble.” It’s impossible to stay the same forever.  LRK: What card from the Tarot deck represents the absolute of your desires? The absolute of your fears?  DL: I always get a little jolt when I get the Ace of Wands. I’m always terrified when I get The Tower, even though I know rationally it can be a positive card given the circumstance.  LRK: Do you remember a circumstance under which drawing The Tower proved positive for you?  DL: Eek, I don’t! It has always been bad, to be honest.  LRK: I had my tarot read by the poet Hoa Nguyen in February, and my circumstance mirrored her own so exactly—moving to Canada for the furthering of a partner’s career—that when she said she’d drawn The Tower before packing up her life, I was certain I was in for your aforementioned terror. (I was lucky: no such Tower-terror arrived, but my four-card spread did include the Five of Pentacles.)  DL: Oh, I am so glad you didn’t get it! I remember once, a long time ago, I had a Sagittarius boyfriend who was moving from his old apartment to a new life, and he painted some symbol of his own making that represented to him a kind of rebirth right on his old wall. When he showed me the painting, he seemed pleased and explained how important this idea was to him. I’ve always thought his explanation was like the way people try to make you feel better about The Tower card when you get a reading. They will say, “Oh no, don’t worry, out of destruction comes rebirth.” I’ve never trusted that idea completely. I love zero destruction at all times and just moving on, not tearing the whole thing down before you go.  LRK: You’re so definitive! I love that. I feel like it’s not just tarot card readers that consider destruction as a means to rebirth. Nietzsche (“I love those who do not know how to live, except by going under, for they are those that cross over”), T.S. Eliot (“These fragments I have shored against my ruins”), Anne Carson, Terry Tempest Williams, the list goes on and on. I suppose, though, that the poet is a kind of tarot card reader—there is a lot of overlap in the hypothetical Venn diagram. Eliot even wrote of the tarot in The Waste Land , “with a wicked pack of cards.”  DL: Or as Plath said in “Daddy”: “And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack.”  LRK: (I’ll take your Plath quote over my Eliot quote any day.)  DL: I think poets are absolutely spiritual workers, dealing in divinatory objects, which are in their case, poems. Although I think that this connection sometimes serves to mystify the role of a poet in society even further than it is already. I personally think it should make it clearer. People sometimes want the work of poetry to be all brain and part of a linear, cerebral process, when it is more complicated than that and involves the most holy type of thinking of all — creativity. The brain itself is the greatest divinatory object of all. I guess, who knows, but I myself worship at the altar of creative thinking.  LRK: Like thousands (343K+) of other Twitter users, I follow you and Alex Dimitrov : the Astro Poets ( @poetastrologers ). It’s so clear to me the influence poetry and astrology can have on one another, but I’m wondering how becoming a ‘poet astrologer’ has changed your poetic process not on or via Twitter.  DL: Thank you for following us! I feel that I have always had an interest in the ways in which poetry and the spiritual world interact, so I am not sure that Astro Poets has changed this about my poetic process or poetry writing. I remember when I started getting really obsessed with astrology, almost 20 years ago now, a friend asked me, “Since you like it so much, will you start putting more astrology into your poems?” I remember how confused I was by this question, only because I believe in the idea of emergence when it comes to writing poems and I don’t go into a poem thinking I am going to write ‘about’ anything. But writing with Alex for our Twitter, our columns at W  Magazine , and the book we are writing together, we do have to write ‘about’ astrology and poetry, so I guess I’d say that the Twitter has affected my idea of writing for these types of forums, which as a poet I didn’t consider as seriously, as they weren’t available to me in the same way. I’d say for sure that writing for Astro Poets has affected my sense of the scope of prose and what kinds of prose writing I am interested in doing in the years to come.  LRK: Can you elaborate on this idea of prose and scope?  DL: Aside from Astro Poets, I’ve had some opportunities in the past five years that have opened up the idea that I could write prose in some form and not be limited to just writing poems. I am currently finishing a book of lectures on poetry, which should be out in the coming months. After that, I hope to finish at least one other book of prose. Also, I’ve written a few prose pieces lately for online publications (which you can find here and here ), and I’d love to do more writing like this in the near future.  LRK: And I cannot wait to read more writing like that in the near future!  You recently took part in a residency at Mount Analogue . What does a Twitter residency mean to you? How are you navigating the digital space, and how is it different than how you might approach a physical or place-based residency? This is not to say that digital space does not have a ‘placeness.’  DL: I loved doing this residency! The people who run Mount Analogue are so nice and I think it is such a fabulous idea to invite visitors to occupy a digital space in this way. I have never been to a formal residency in a ‘place’ and would love to go to one sometime, so I am not sure how it is different. But I would assume that there would be something very different, as no matter how much the digital landscape occupies our imaginations and actual beings, it was different to post on the Twitter during a regular day of everyday life, versus the idea of going and being somewhere for a long time. When I did my posts at Mount Analogue , I thought about creating a cohesiveness to what I was writing. I think Twitter lends itself to this. When you have a Twitter account, you sort of have to have a theme or else people might get confused. If it’s an individual person’s Twitter, then the theme can, of course, just be that person’s performance of themselves, like the way a persona performs their mask in a collection of poems or across a poet’s work. My residency got me thinking about all kinds of other Twitters one could create to give poetry more attention by Twitter users.  LRK: Astro Poets seems like one such Twitter account, giving poetry a ‘mainstream’ spotlight.  My next question exists purely because I have you “on the line.” In “ Astrological Sign Poem ,” published in LitHub , you write, “Capricorn, you are nothing if not hell.” I’m a Capricorn and identify strongly with this line, but can you to parse your sentiment for me and for Adroit readers?  DL: It’s hard to completely explain it. I’ll just say that Capricorns love lushness and hell is certainly nothing if not lush.  LRK: A love of “lushness.” I’m so glad I’ve attempted to curb my questions for you; I’m prone to asking questions with long explanations .  What is the last book you purchased, and where did you purchase it?  DL : R E D by Chase Berggrun . I got it from the poet at Mark Cugini and Layne Ransom’s engagement reading. It’s fantastic and everyone should buy it immediately!  LRK: One last request: please give this interview an epigraph.  Back to Issue Twenty-Six .       Lauren R. Korn  Lauren R.

Links  FAQ                      Review   August 30, 2018   Shown to be mirrors: An omnibus review of Milk, That Which Comes After, and small siren   by  Luiza Flynn-Goodlett               0     Dorothea Lasky’s Milk ( Wave Books , 2018), Alexis Pope’s That Which Comes After ( Big Lucks , 2018), and Alexandra Mattraw’s small siren ( The Culture Society , 2018).   Some books do something new within the poetic space, while others challenge our understanding of what poetry can do. Three new collections by Dorothea Lasky, Alexis Pope, and Alexandra Mattraw are the second type, enriching and expanding our understanding of what poetry is and what it might become.  In Lasky’s Milk , anything and everything is only a turn away, whether through metaphor’s web of associations or simply the poet’s inexhaustible imagination. It’s hallucinogenic: in these pages, individual identity falls away and, in exchange, the reader is given access to something like shared consciousness. This all-encompassing, fervent voice comes into focus in poems like “Little Kingdom.”  We are no better than those Who walk the earth And the worms we ingest will make us strong Everybody has a patch of dirty Where they plant their green peril Everybody makes the sign of the star On their forehead To let the devil know It’s me, Lord, it’s me Come home  This pace engenders anxiety and foreboding, the poetic equivalent of glancing over a shoulder, sure someone’s following, which serves its subject matter, since death (always one step behind us all) swirls through Lasky’s  collection like a cold wind. In “The book of stars and the universe,” Lasky writes, “In the dream my father took my dog / He brought her to the other world / My dog I miss you / My father I miss you.”  Pope similarly grapples with the surreal aspect of loss in That Which Comes After. ” “I didn’t feel the passing // Of my grandmother but it happened // The same as my own” (“LET’S START ALL OUR FRIENDSHIPS”). However, while Pope’s specificity gives lie to the very idea of a universal, her speaker wants to be witnessed, just in a truer and more direct way, as in “BUYING TAMPONS,” where she commands, “Look at me // I’m crying don’t // Look away.”  Mattraw picks up this theme in poems like “The Day Before the Burial,” where “Night air fills lilacs, a soon darkness / rustles in the back room.” This speaker is porous; familial relations and natural landscape blur her edges until “we’re all / temporary / a constellation / mind” (“Triangulation”).  This is where these three collections most directly communicate—in highlighting how women (in their ability to create life, along with the monthly expelling of potential life) are in constant proximity to the stuff of creation and destruction, and therefore, have something unique and urgent to say about where life and death rub against each other. In fact, the Milk evoked by Lasky’s title is the useless, painful kind that comes after a miscarriage, as detailed in “The clog.”  The place With the dead babies But no matter what I did How hard I yanked She would never leave I knocked and knocked  Miscarriage is a death that our society doesn’t allow to be mourned—a primal, deeply disorienting loss that women are often isolated within, without a familiar script or way of expressing their grief. And there’s little compassion for a loss that so calls into question the way we believe life should go, as in “The miscarriage.”  The women of the world say Work harder!  The men of the world say Work harder!  Pope’s speaker in That Which Comes After attempts to offer support for this same loss in poems like “ALL MY FRIENDS LIVING DIFFERENT,” asserting that “There’s no talking about sky // Not while S holds a belly full // Of used to be life, the swell // remains thumpless.” Of course this speaker’s flat-footed; there’s simply no language to reach across this gulf, as in “I MEAN THERE ARE SPECIFIC”: “Feel better my friend // Texts me I’m worried // About her miscarriage // Is that too blunt.”  Mattraw’s small siren frames these revelations by illuminating the mysterious, baffling experience that even a successful birth engenders in poems like “/ Dilation /.”  / swimming you emerge /  forty weeks under / screaming in a stranger / palm reading your first body / How  will I know it’s you?  These larger thematic arguments are further bolstered by the collections’ formal choices. Where Lasky minimizes punctuation, allowing lines to flow like a tide that inexorably rises to drown the reader, in That Which Comes After, Pope uses line breaks to stumble us, calling attention to the constructed nature of poetry to implicitly question and undercut it, as in “THIS IS NOT ANOTHER BIRD POEM.”  What gets stuck to my fingers  When I’m half alone  In the situation call back  Unknown numbers on my phone.  Mattraw’s small siren keeps the reader at a similar remove, unpacking and bursting apart poetic structure in increasingly interesting ways. For example, there’s a poem that runs as a footnote across the bottom of the right, blank pages of the book’s first section.  In their own ways, each collection plays with scale, turning lyric binoculars toward grand horizons and then back to the interior. And, ultimately, those vantage points are shown to be mirrors, the divisions between them constructed by individual ego. Simultaneously, concepts of time and space are revealed for their triviality as the reader is invited to move through poetic time. As Pope’s speaker declares in “THERE’S A RIVER IN PENNSYLVANIA,” “Take the big clock off the wall // It’s too early or late for time.”  On the poetic plane these collections traverse, all things are equally exalted and insignificant, beautiful and ugly, powerful and weak. In fact, those very distinctions are rendered meaningless. And, once you give yourself over to it, letting it overwhelm you, there’s something like transcendence to be found in poems like Lasky’s “Kill Marry Fuck.”  Sixty years later A bomb of women An entire country of women Two women in the countryside A pale green tapestry Washed white by the seashore The world  Within this glorious cacophony, there are moments of almost uncanny lucidity, as if a delirium is briefly lifted as someone looks you in the eye with a jolt of recognition, like this moment in Pope’s “BUYING TAMPONS,” “Over time we // Capsize into whatever // We’ve been running toward” or Lasky’s “Winter Plums.”  She’s gonna die  We all are  Until then, the weather  The cold sweet fruit  These collections articulate a radical freedom that reaffirms poetry’s core promise of possibility. In Milk , Lasky’s insistence on her own dream-like logic wrests the reader into an alternate state of consciousness and makes room for her poems to be—and say—almost anything. There’s the searing beauty of moments like “In the morning touching the wrist you will know what life is” in “A hospital room,” the self-effacing sincerity of “My friend once came over / And read me her poems so freely / I wanted to / But I couldn’t abandon her” in “Ghost flight to the moon,” and the surreal sadness of “My mind / A bloodhound / For oblivion” in “Floral pattern.” Pope’s sincerity has a similar effect, giving the reader a giddy sense of expansion, while the speaker makes herself small, intimate enough to confide that “BUYING TAMPONS” “Is like buying diapers // It doesn’t end // Until it does.”  Ultimately, these poets embody so many selves and modes of being that they return us to one of the oldest archetypes of the poet—the trickster. These poet-tricksters open space for uncertainty and questioning, demonstrate the ways in which we’re stuck in useless patterns of thinking, and upend tired assumptions that underlie cultural systems of power. As Lasky’s “Snakes” articulates, “The time in-between / When you feel that poetry is the last thing you need / That’s the time you need poetry most of all.” There’s no way to anticipate what comes next in these collections, no expected route ever taken, but the reader is grateful to follow them off the path and into the dark, nourishing unknown.

Charles has an MFA from the University of Arizona and is pursuing a PhD in English at UC Irvine. She currently resides in Long Beach, CA.  ***  Brad Trumpfheller: Hello! How are you?  Jos Charles: Hi Brad! I’m good, how are you?  BT: I’m good! Could have slept better, but at this point that’s not a deviation from the normal.  JC: I wish there was an easy solution to that. It’s a life of perpetual under sleep, bad eating habits, and just, coping.  BT: That’s very, very real. What does your day look like today?  JC: Well, I’m starting in the fall at UC Irvine for a PhD in English with a focus on Medieval Literature, and I got summer funding contingent on going to these professionalization workshops and orientation.  BT: Are you finding the time, in the midst of getting ready for the PhD and everything, to keep up some sort of writing practice?  JC: Probably not writing in the sense of creating new work every day. I have a newer manuscript that’s not done, but it’s to the point where I am editing it every day.  BT: You know, I wasn’t planning to start with the newer stuff, but I’m excited: do you want to talk at all about this newer manuscript?  JC: Yeah! I guess after writing feeld , a couple of things… I found that I was liking the process of observing things and writing about them, which occurs a lot in feeld. There’s a lot of particularizing that happens in the book, but also these general statements that Safe Space  had a lot of. So with this newer work, it’s a bit less of, like, analysis as much as it is looking at things and the relationships between them, whether that be the so-called natural, the metropolitan, or the political.  When I was in the voice that is feeld —and I think this is just what happens after working on something for a few years—I was at the point where I wanted to write straightforward poems. Poems that weren’t part of some constricted, conceptual project that feeld very much was. Though there’s some underlying conceptual work happening in this project, in that it’s following a one year period, 2016. It was a weird year.  BT: Yeah, that’s very, very true.  JC: For everyone, right? But there was also a lot of personal things. Financial stuff, I had a few friends who were hospitalized. And then the election happened. Also, I was in Tuscon at the time, and the mountain that overlooked the city was on fire, and then I moved back to LA in the middle of the year, when all those fires were going on. Everything was quite actually on fire. I keep on returning to figure out what happened in that time. It feels like it was a significant year. You know, there are those periods to which we return, these dates that impact beyond themselves, and 2016 felt like that for me, personally. So, I’m charting that, this new timeline that’s opened up. It’s like you know, in sci-fi, when the dark timeline breaks into the regular timeline: we’re in the underbelly timeline now. There was a rift in the curtain, then the Demigorgon came in.  BT: Haha, exactly. Were you still working on feeld in 2016, or had you pretty much wrapped it up?  JC: By then I was more or less finished with what would be feeld . I started writing some of the work that I’d consider part of this newer manuscript, though that’s all been heavily edited or scrapped by this point in the process. There was some period of overlap. I would be writing these newer things alongside the, like, exiting from feeld . But yeah, feeld was mostly written between like, the summer of 2014 to the summer of 2015, I’d say.  BT: Was there any similar kind of overlap in the progression, or not progression, but the movement from the poems in Safe Space to writing feeld ?  JC: The expression I’ve used before for Safe Space is that it’s the early collected works. It spans a gamut of, like, eight years, I think. And I did edit a lot of it. At one point there was a manuscript that looked one way, and I submitted that around; it didn’t get in anywhere. I left it, started new work, just like considered it… I don’t know. Like Brahms, light it on fire and this will never happen again, you know? And then in that new work, I was seeing these connections back to what I had written in undergrad. So I sat down, \\xa0revisiting a lot of it. Even the work that came out of that period that’s in there, it’s all severely edited. Then that would eventually become Safe Space , which I compiled in 2014. There was a gap in the writing process, this big gap, between the writing of Safe Space and feeld . But in terms of publication, it was pretty back to back.  BT: Gotcha. This is a super general question, but I wanna circle back to something you said earlier, that “voice of feeld ,” and just the notion of considering it a unified voice. Can you talk a little bit about how you arrived at that voice, with its apparent weirdnesses in the spelling and syntaxes?  JC: So there’s a number of different things. Let me try and sort of chart what I was feeling, and walk concentrically around it, hopefully finding the center by the time I’m done.  Growing up, my first introduction to poetry was early modern poets—Shakespeare, Milton. The first real poet who I really liked, whose collected poems I went to go buy from the used bookstore was John Donne.  BT: “John Donne had everything going for him in terms of identity and was a miserable shit baby.”  JC: Haha, exactly. God, that poem was so long back when I wrote it. I’m glad it got edited down. But, yeah, who I was thinking of in terms of the orthography, the spelling, was Spenser. That beginning of the standardization of spelling, and what that means, what that says about the world moving from the oral, the aural, from the public, to something that is meant to be read in private, in silence. Which is a new thought. A new thought for what poetry would be in Western Europe. So you go from public space to the private home. And so there was this thought, that had to happen in order for standardized spelling to come to exist as it did. Which something like the printing press would facilitate further.  I was also thinking about, after Safe Space , that I like the internet, am a true millennial. I love text speak. So I kept trying to get text speak in a poem that didn’t seem disingenuously trendy. Because I enjoyed it. I like the interpretive possibilities it opens up. And also it’s just how we talk.  There’s also this discourse in queer and trans communities, that was happening online, where suddenly using the correct terminology became indicative of what subcultural sphere you belonged to, or were speaking about. Where like, oh, I know to say “trans women and femmes” as opposed to “MTF transsexuals.” People wanted to find the right thing to say, which is good, you know. But then there are these questions of like, who has access to it and who doesn’t?  BT: Sure, sure.  JC: It was in part dictated by whether or not you had internet access, who has time to be one hundred percent updated, every day.  So out of these things I’ve been walking around, I had the thought that it would be cool to have some sort of language that didn’t seek to situate itself as corrective, nor did it ironically break into incorrectness. The very idea was to write not a world situated adjacent to ours that was speculative, but to have the language itself be speculative. One of the ways I thought about it, or how I described it to myself, because at the time I was finishing up Safe Space , was to have something I could say to myself before sitting down to write, to like orient myself to whatever particular project I was working on. So for feeld it was “What if the Wife of Bath was trans?” How would language have developed differently?  And of course it’s nonsense in one sense. And it’s just unknowable. But it was a way for me to frame myself to this question, if language had taken a slightly different turn to accommodate certain kinds of experiences, yet we wound up where we are today. How would language be failing us and how would it be succeeding us? As I started writing it, certain things fell by the wayside, and certain things would fall more into focus. I was tinkering away at the marble to find the shape of what the book would eventually become. For the speculative side, I was initially conceiving it very much in line with something like Cathy Park Hong’s Engine Empire , which is a more literal speculative work. But things came about in writing it; like I came into the treatise-like quality of it, where it enters a phenomenological kind of language. I wasn’t expecting that; I wandered into that.  BT: There’s so much you said that I want to ask you about! One thing I’m thinking about now is sort of the way, in certain kinds of contemporary discourse, queer and trans people are sort of categorized or prescribed as being predominantly younger, that queerness is some kind of new phenomenon. Which of course is not true. But I think about how Safe Space spoke back to that by inhabiting the space of juvenellia, and then how feeld might, like, embody the impossibility of that anachronism on the level of these formal things we’re talking about.  JC: Yeah, that’s a nice kind of trajectory. I’ve thought about that kind of thing for both works separately, but I like that way of drawing a connection between them.  BT: When you were talking earlier about Spenser and that groundshift in English language poetics that happened, I was wondering about feeld’ s relationship to that duality of the written and the spoken. There’s a very different kind of experience, and they’re both valuable, but there’s a different experience in hearing these particular poems read aloud and reading them on the page, and how the audience experiences that speculative language. How do you navigate those kinds of distinctions?  JC: Right. I try to think about readings as their own life. To me, it’s no different than, for the purposes of analogy, a score for a piece of music. The performances can have such a large range of variety. You can play it very slow or you can play it very fast, and people will probably still recognize it. At some point you hit unintelligibility, when people will say, “No, you just played Drake, that’s not the same thing!” And maybe that’s helpful to do, I don’t know. It’d be kind of fun, though, to have a big bougie concert and you play Drake. Then the point becomes being unrecognizable to an audience. But as long as you’re within the realm of “acceptable” interpretation, as long as it’s still intelligible as the thing it presents as, then it’s all good. When I do readings, I try to think about what people are there for, what would be useful in that context. Depending on the audience, depending on what I’m reading for, it varies. Usually I try to highlight intelligibility.  BT: Was that at all something you were thinking about in the process of editing feeld ? Like, did you have any moments where you were concerned with readers being unable to make sense of the poems?  JC: For me, the poet is the first reader. You hear the work first. You have to edit then as that reader, asking if the work makes sense, if it’s useful, to you. But the question of, is this useful to other readers not like me is a question of publication. It becomes, at some point, a question of how the work is to exist, circulate, in the world.  There was a time when I thought about it much more. But now, I have a surety that I’ve found for myself as a reader, not just myself as a writer. And once I found that, I found this faith that there are other readers like me who my work could also be useful for. But y’know, that’s ultimately for readers to decide, not me.  BT: Sure, sure, sure. That’s interesting. I feel like I asked that question, and then like, the other voice in my head was immediately unsure about its use, like, of course the poems don’t need to be “understood” by everyone who reads it, whatever that means.  JC: Haha, and that’s the thing, right? What does it mean to understand something? If I look at it as a piece of art and it causes pleasure, or it reminds me of something in a nostalgic kind of way, or gives me some flush of happiness, or I am challenged by it, whatever response I have to it—that’s fine, I’m just not preoccupied with the level of meaning. I’m stuck on what is the work doing, in an active way. And if it’s not doing anything, that can be fine too.  BT: I think, sort of going off these question of availability, or access, I wanted to ask you about this author’s note that got shipped with the ARC of feeld . I guess its kind of a stupid logistical question, but what I have is just two or three printed pages stapled together and tucked into the front cover of the book. Is this going to be a part of the book that will be in bookstores and what not?  JC: No, it’s not going to be in the book at all. I wrote that to be—initially when I was sending the book around—an abstract for the book. You know, for blurbs or reviews, or whatever, if they didn’t have time to read the whole thing. I also made a trailer for it, which is out in the world. But it won’t be in the copy people can purchase. I had thought about including it, but sort of decided that it attempted to explain what the book was doing. I do like it, though.  BT: Yeah, I really enjoyed reading it! I found it a cool little accompaniment to the book. But now I feel bad for talking about this text that someone reading this doesn’t have.  JC: No, no, I think it’s good; it’s going to have a life in the world, so it’s something worth talking about. I do like that they folded it up and slipped it in the book, I may have them do that for all of them. But that may be too enormous an amount of labor for such little payoff.  BT: It’s an enormous payoff, though I don’t envy being those marketing interns. I feel like I’m bridging outside of the book itself, the poems themselves, now, but I did want to ask you about the acknowledgements, if only because I was very drawn to you naming Paul Celan specifically as a forebear. Can I ask how you see Celan in conversation with feeld , or with your poems more generally?  JC: I like Celan, I like his poems a lot. There is something technically, on the level of the word, beyond thematics or anything, that I’m drawn to in his work. Repetition, the economy of language. The way that turning outward towards an object can be an opening rather than a closing. How his poems can be so highly personal but not anecdotal. Which I think something like feeld— and Safe Space , too, maybe in a longer format—also has. Like you don’t leave either book with a sense, I think, that you’ve gotten memoir. The personality of the “I” is not the focal point. And yeah, in feeld , there’s a bit more of a lyric “I,” there’s very little overlap with my “I” beyond like an analogical sense. So, there’s that impulse we share. Celan will have poems that include events that happened. Like I’m thinking when he visited Heidegger’s hut, Todtnauberg, the one that begins with the well that’s shaped like a star. And becomes about “Celan’s” self, but only as much as that’s a weight pressing onto the poem, it doesn’t come with an explanation. You don’t need one. And of course, none of this is to make any kind of lineage, between Celan and me, any biographical or psychological comparisons. Only in terms of what I learned from his work that I try to apply, that I hope, technically, comes across in the poems. Does that make sense?  BT: It does, it does.  JC: It’s a difficult question to fully answer, I think, but it’s a good one to ask.  BT: We’ve been chatting for about forty minutes, so I do think we’re nearing the end, but is there anything else you’d like to talk about? We began with what you’re working on now, so the anti-chronology of all this is in full affect now.  JC: I can definitely talk about some of the things I’d recommend, what’s been exciting to me right now.

If at any point I ask you about something that you don’t want to address, please say so. I’m happy to redirect.  I’ve read and reread What Runs Over leading up to our conversation, and having this collection as a companion has carried me through the rough first weeks of spring. I don’t mean to report that this is a comforting read. Yet, as I read, I felt myself settle into what felt like an old friendship in which intimacy and candor and shared history function in equal parts. Before we begin, I want to take the opportunity to thank you for writing this tremendously generous book and setting it loose in the world.  For a collection so honest, so transparent, I’m struck by the presence of absence in What Runs Over . For example, in the opening poem, you write,  my daddy almost pumped me full of lead.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 my daddy almost left me for so ask me why I hate animals  With the omission of the expected rhyme of “dead,” you draw more attention to what is being implied than what is explicit. What role does absence play in your work? What do you omit, consciously or otherwise?  Kayleb Rae Candrilli: This is a super good question, and one I’m happy you asked. I think absence and omission operate in a few ways in WRO . In the case of the omitted rhyme “dead,” I think I am trying to do a few things: build tension, yes, but also let readers know that I will never be willing (or able, for that matter) to give them the whole story. The ways in which I’ve dissociated from my own memories are powerful, and, of course, part of the reason I’ve been able to move forward at all. Sometimes, when I omit, or redirect, or redact, I am trying to protect myself/&/or my family. It’s not always tethered to a consideration of craft. Sometimes, I just don’t want to remember how close my father was to killing me, my mother, my sister.  On page 58 I redact visually and “black out” what my sister was wearing at the DHR office. I did this in one part because I don’t remember what she wore. But I also redacted this way to protect her. I did this to exert control and feel as though, as an older sibling, I could still exhibit some protective qualities—even though my whole childhood was without agency, and truly, I couldn’t protect her at all. Much of this book is just a clamoring to retroactively claim agency.  In early drafts of WRO I had much more visually redacted. I remember bringing in a few early pages to a workshop at the University of Alabama and a peer used an electronic version of the pages to look underneath the redactions, and they found long strings of periods and slashes and underscores. In the moment, I felt so invaded by that action, but it also helped me understand the ways in which I was coping with my trauma, or, maybe more accurately, not coping.  After that, I really started to use surrealism to reclaim the memories. On page 83 I write:  as a child i made lists / i made lists of meat and meaty parts / my mother would caldron catch me stirring rabbit’s feet, my dog’s clipped toe nails, beaks of turkey and grouse, the liver of a fawn daddy killed out of season / daddy’d say, the young ones are so tender / and i’d keep stirring and my mother started to worry that i wasn’t getting enough sun, that all the meat i ate was just a little too green to be good / she said what’s wrong with you and i poured her an elixir / i said here mommy, this is for you and me, it will invisible us, it will make daddy wonder where we’ve gone to / mommy, this is the good drink / she humored me, took the glass-vialed potion and put it on a shelf of birthday party sand arts / and it sat there and it sat there and it rotted through the glass and it acid tore through each floor and me and mommy lava jumped through the living room right before the whole damn house burnt down with daddy still in it / and after i took mommy’s hand, said, pointing to only ash, see? invisible.  There is no lava in rural Pennsylvania, but there is heroin addiction, and domestic abuse, and an undying desire to escape. I don’t have to tell you that life would have been easier with my father dead. I don’t have to tell you that I wanted the heroin to take him—or that the house never burnt down. You already know that.  But all the omission, the redactions, the reclamation of memory through surrealism, is how all of this trauma can live inside of me without consuming all the good stuff. And I’m so invested in the good.  RFW: In your answer, you’ve touched on something that I experienced during my time with WRO . For every instance of trauma, there are responding moments of exhilaration, joy even, at the experience of existing in your body. In this, what is “bad” and what is “good” become complicated, tangled. Perhaps my favorite moment of this occurs in the poem on page 17 in which young Kayleb violently rushes at deer, only to lie in the “dry-warm patches” of grass exposed after the animals scatter. Here, what is professed to be an aggressive act reveals what is hidden beneath bodies and what is revealed is beautiful and feels warm on the skin.  I understand that you are currently working on a new collection that allows for transness and joy to exist simultaneously. First, thank you. Second, is this new collection more anticipatory, more forward-thinking? Or will it return to moments in childhood where joy was present? Could it do one without the other?  KCR: I think the second collection, tentatively titled All the Gay Saints , intentionally strays from childhood. I needed a full departure from WRO in regards to content and tonal register. I needed that departure to grow as a writer, but also have some respite from writing about trauma.  So instead, All the Gay Saints , is, I believe, a book of trans boy love poems, to my partner, but also to my body—as you can see me think through the decision to get top surgery.  A poem that, I think, does work in both regards is “During my top surgery consultation, my partner says to the doctor, tell me what you will do to their veins.” Which is  right here with Tinderbox if you want to check it out in full. But the last few couplets read:  I am scared of my partner  being face to face with my blood because I love them.  When we talk of the future, my future chest is as flat as our future backyard. We plant  a lemon tree and it grows even in winter.  This tone of hope is one I try to maintain and cultivate throughout All the Gay Saints . In this way, it feels like it’s a productive sequel to WRO . I joke a lot that the happiest part of WRO is seeing my author photo at the end, where I am grinning ear to ear. But really, it’s so exciting to be alive and to have lived and be living through it all. It was a contentious decision to make that my author photo. Young trans folx will read the book, and that’s the last thing they will see. I love that.  But to get back to the question, the new book names my partner my “future husband-wife” and runs that nomenclature throughout the book. So in a very textual, up-front kind of way, the book is anticipatory and thinking toward a future—a future where two gender non-conforming people are alive, and happy, and thriving outside of the pain that is so often prescribed to us by this world.  Childhood appears sometimes, but namely as a way to show how cool it is to be owning these bodies in the present. In “ My horoscope is my future husband’s horoscope & we are both considering T ” I write:  Husband, nothing is holy like self-construction.  Our fathers built staircases & we are bringing sledgehammers to our bodies so gently only we can hear this pleasure.  There is nowhere to go but into one another.  Something I’m aware of is the book’s (and my) participation in the social, capitalist, and hetro-patriarchal subscription to marriage. I believe that mine and my partners’ bodies do a lot to queer the institution of marriage but surely not, and perhaps never, enough. I think the future I reference so often will teach us how to productively queer the institution more once we are in it, but we will still be “in it.” It’s just something I recognize and would rather be forthright about. I, and we, are still learning, as queer people, how to mitigate our desire for marriage with the ethical hang-ups that inherently come hand-in-hand.  RFW: In both of the poems you’ve shared above, future seems to be a thing gently built by your own hands. My impression is that the future envisioned here could not manifest in an urban environment and exists, if only within the landscape of these poems, in a rural space. If in WRO you write of the violence and unpredictability of the rural, in these poems rural landscapes allow for the freedom to explore change. But in both WRO and these newer poems, I see creation of remarkably queer rural spaces in the inextricable relationships between body and environment. Can you speak some to your understanding of rural queerness? Does it have definable aesthetic?  KRC: This is perhaps one of the most nuanced and intuitive questions I’ve ever been asked. So, thank you for it.  Everything can be two things. Rural Pennsylvania can be where heroin addiction tore my family apart, it can be where animals were cruelly poached out of season, where I was beaten, etc. But it can also be where I first kissed another queer person, where I was shirtless in the forest alone and only worried about ticks, where I realized the trees didn’t care much about my gender, and maybe I shouldn’t either. It was all of those things simultaneously.  When you are inside of something, lost in something, it is hard to see where one begins and another ends. It’s taken me a while, but I don’t fault the land for the behavior of those who lived on it. I think that’s why my “future” is willing to inhabit a rural space, a rural space where two queer people will treat each other with gentleness and love and respect, a rural space where two queer people will grocery shop and a young trans kid will see us, and thusly see a possible future for themselves.  I reflect a lot on my time chopping wood, and how that performance of “masculinity” helped lead me through the conscious beginnings of my queerness, and how I also used it as a violent physical outlet to work through the trauma that was happening around and onto me. And, additionally, it was an act that kept my mother and sister warm during winter. It’s hard not to be thankful for that kind of physical work, when it yielded so much I still consider productive and fundamental to my personhood. I think that admiration and appreciation comes through in most of my poetry.  I think too, and your question gets to this, that rural space provides just that, space—both literal and figurative. There is room to be alone, room to spend time thinking about your body and your body’s relationship to the landscape. What you lose in all that space, of course, is seeing other bodies like yours. Rural queers are, rightfully, so hungry for representation.  I have a new poem and a sentence in it reads, “I believe strongly that had I known one trans person as a child I’d have half as many scars as an adult.” I believe that, but I also know said scars look more to me like the wet earth after a tree uproots, than a pothole in pavement. And that, after all this time I’ve spent healing, is beautiful and peaceful in its own right.  I guess what I wish for the future is that rural queer representation is more prevalent in all the artistic fields. I certainly write hoping that young rural trans folxs will find my work, and then find something to hold in it.  Sometimes, when I know I’m signing a book for someone who came up rural, I sign with something like “This landscape can’t keep us down.” And for me, that is the rural aesthetic. The rural aesthetic is saying “this landscape can’t keep us down” a million different ways, until we all really believe it.  RFW: What you’ve written about existing in a rural space as a queer person resonated with me and I hope to forgive my rural landscape in the same way that you have. The only way that I felt it possible to transition was to partition my lives, was to move, was to cut off communication. For many years, I equated rural to the closet, and, though nothing charges my spirit like Wyoming landscapes, being in that state has been in the past an act of silence. But recently, my two distinct identities have begun to join more frequently. T he experience is often odd and anxiety-making, but the relief that has come in the joining has been tremendous. In it, I believe I’ve begun to allow others to really be with me. Not as I am on the page or in selfies, but as a physical body before them in that moment. Perhaps this will get me home again. I’d like if it would.  One thing I’ve realized in transition is that nearly everything I’ve held true about myself is tenuous and demands to be turned and turned again. With that exploration, transition becomes contradiction and frustrates my conception of self unless I allow for spontaneous, near constant re-calibration. If transition is contradiction, writing about transition is an effort to make movement tangible, and perhaps what I find most confounding about creating art from transition is that it grants rigidity to an amorphous and continual progress. What has been your experience of having WRO as a physical representation of your self in the world shaping the perceptions of others who may not personally know you? Do you think others look to it to understand trans identity as a whole? Should they?  KRC: I’m glad it resonated and I think a partition is so healthy. The end of WRO is in fact a marker of partition:  The last deer I reach for meets the front of a metro north.  What is more of a partition than that?—the epitome of urban life, the metro north, crashing into a quintessential signifier of the American rural, the white-tailed deer. And though that partition helped me move forward, I am thankful for the ways it is currently dissolving, as it is helping me grow into a more honest version of myself.  But to your question, I wrote WRO as I was coming out as trans. It is written very much in a moment of realization and power and reclamation. That said, I think it’s very likely that some cis readers might mistake WRO for a text meant to understand a wholistic “trans identity.” I really hope they don’t. And I’m sure many cis readers will have the nuance and political awareness to understand that my body in one moment isn’t the end-all be-all of the trans identity—not even close. But I think trans readers are already so well versed in transition as amorphous and confounding that they won’t mistake WRO as anything more than a moment, a beginning of one person’s transition—a transition that will exist and last as long as my earthly body exists. There is no point A or point B, just a body chugging along.  I notice more from readers how the BDSM strains throughout WRO shape their perceptions of me. I think that may be just as dangerous a tendency as assuming I’m some ~trans~ monolith. Sexuality is just as fluid as gender, and it’s interesting to see people make assumptions about my sexuality/kinks/etc. with not much consideration of how time and new relationships and, in my case, less alcohol abuse can alter behavior and preference and a sex life. Again, there is just a body chugging along, and the things it wants are always shifting.  But to get back to writing about and through transition, I do find it important to write and then just move along. When I revise, I revise for craft and not for the content or the ways in which I handle my own body. It’s going to change. It’s going to keep changing. In that way it feels like a productive way to document whatever “transition” it is I’m walking through. The whole body of my work is what can illustrate transition as amorphous and spontaneous. It’s important for me that each piece not try to be to big for its britches. That said though, the most recent poem I drafted tried very much to gesture to the feeling of spontaneity and recalibration you’ve described. And while it may not be a slamming poem, it matters to me. The last lines read:  this poem is not so much about a beach as it is about arriving there,  blowing stop signs until the coast affirms  that lines are always changing, and the tide  tells me my body can morph, just as many times as it needs.  RFW: So much of the work that you are doing, both with WRO and in your daily existence, pushes you towards community. But, having returned to a rural place after completing your MFA (and please correct me if I’m mistaken), you must have greater access to extended community than you did as a young person. Has leaving altered your understanding of what a rural community is? Do your communities (local, extended, poetry) ever join?  KRC:  Well, though the future I reference so often in the new book is rural, I actually live in Philadelphia right now—which is pretty chalk full of community in all respects. It can be overwhelming sometimes, actually. I certainly don’t think I’m cut out for city living long term.  That all said, after my MFA, I spent half a year in Throop, PA, trying to get my feet under me and prepare for and heal from top surgery. My time there was so dreamy. It’s a relatively low income town with all these brightly colored small houses—a ton of pinwheels and “beware of dog signs” in yards and windows. Almost like an inland beach town. There, I felt myself spending a lot of time on the phone with friends from my MFA, and from Penn State before that. I would spend time on the phone while walking through the town—willfully ignoring any stares from locals that might not want me there. I thought that was a big indication of how extended community was protecting me, and helping me feel supported—despite their distance. Throop, PA was also where I crowd-funded my top surgery. And all my communities (familial, local, extended, poetry) held me up and joined to facilitate my having a better quality of life. The kindness still astonishes me and I feel grateful every day. Though loneliness, in an immediate physical sense, was still something that happened in Throop, it was so very different than my young experience.  But in terms of rural community, I believe it’s important to outsource (I’m thinking virtually here) while you try to build or join something on the ground. I think it’s important to understand, too, that in rural settings, if you’re lacking a feeling of community, there is a chance it really just doesn’t exist yet. You’re often not missing out on something already in existence. You may just have to build it, as small or as big as you’re comfortable with. And they will come. Queers are everywhere. Cute, and everywhere.  RFW: I truly don’t think you could have set up my final question any better. We’ve spent so much of this interview speaking about the future, and about what is involved in its realization. Will you do so one more time? When you look to the future, what does your community look like? Your home? Tell me about the trees, the animals, the people.  KRC:  When I look to the future I see a community of queer people hell-bent on helping to facilitate one another’s happiness and wellbeing. I see contentious mentorship and support for the younger generation. I see a community that won’t allow young folxs to reach their mid-twenties before they can see themselves in poems, in stories, in music, in film and in painting, in all art and media in general. I see timely torch-passing, and the equitable sharing of capital in all forms. These are idealistic, yes, but I promise to help make it so. And I know so many others who have promised the same. So that gives me hope.  And my home, that’s wherever my partner is. Cliche? I don’t care at all lol! We are so excited to get old together, and drink coffee together, and poorly tend the house plants together, and name a BernieDoodle Drew Berniemore together, and make home videos together, and make zines together, and one day abandon all things to work summer jobs at the Jersey Shore, just because. Life is short and life is long. We’re going to try to fit it all. <3    Back to Issue Twenty-Six .
