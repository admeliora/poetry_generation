Can machines articulate the human experience as compellingly as humans themselves?

To find out, I scraped poems from digital archives, trained Torch-RNN on my corpus, and generated both free and formal verse. I then showed a portfolio of human-authored and machine-generated poems to two respondent groups: a non-expert group consisting of university students and an expert group consisting of Princeton faculty from the English, Computer Science, and Philosophy departments. Survey respondents were asked to rate each poem with respect to four metrics: impact, poeticism, originality, and a metric I called the Turing Test--whether or not the respondent believed the piece to be machine-generated.
