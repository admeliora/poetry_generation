Sun

with a body 

long since cracked 

the hill and its beginning 
	Waited to understand 
the secret to the stones 
				of dark 
								of heaven
			death 
				at the airport 
	and leafing down 		a can of foggy                   loose stripes 
	(not as we will stand. When

	my head is made of bursts of
	my eyes, lit dream and feathers and primroses 
	and tangle or drift.

	My boy. I stand next to you

and my heart twitches in the dark

from the river.
