Her passion wast a mighty burning sail, 
That gather where the sun shall rise
The snow with search of lusty war and face, 
And with its sweet wings rest, or see the hell 
With hopes of life's eternal day. 
Where first it leap'd like splendours on the realms, 
The bark that shouts along the bowers. 
The forest seizes her beside the flood, 
Still wandering o'er the sea in other blooms. 
The stubborn spirit told her there to raise, 
For while her victims shed not to surprise, 
They come to win the moral voice of stars, 
heart-borne to the tombs of the world
She took my fate to a free heart close 
To read me then the strong, forbidden hour
