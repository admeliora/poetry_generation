You came to everything.
But I was here for your faith.

I tell you I am mine. I wasn’t taken

out of the world to see you scaling my bones
into the vacancy at dawn.

the lamplight fills my hand

on my mouth and then I chew. I want the dark
but I know dawn. I cruised my pristine
terms so I wouldn’t keep my
anxious words
really we all want to think close to you and carry

your city buckets
and I like to be the same as both of us
