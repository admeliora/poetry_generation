She sinks on a strange music of the sea,
A false forgetfulness that might be living, 
And wept on the wide world of the night's shadow;
The form of heavens cleaved their swords along the sea
Captivity was borne in the heart
Into the mountain hills, and caverns of green air, 
The sparkling white silver walls all pale, 
From the garden a blood was scatter'd in their dew;
From the river on the ashes, 
Should we feel again the stride 
Of stars of the sea that we heard 
The homed oaks, where hungry blue new sheep 
Stand all on the mountains of shadows, 
Dear, would you recognise me?
Thou art licked by thine art
Where the wild birds are burned with blue silence
