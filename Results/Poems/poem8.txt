The vision of my mind should weep, 
And sometimes so hard the wild human deed, 
That still the dead shall move a lady's foe, 
And be the charge of state; 
I was so much as I was weak, 
Then will she hide the stars where he was bold; 
Though ever dead it went with some desire, 
And that my heart will never say, 
The slaughter of this deathless frame, 
The quiet sea it seemed, and herd-encircled sleep, 
The sea is shaken and weary and melted and aching. 
While by the lonely torture of the shore, 
Singing with gentle eyes against that song,
Singing with the blue eyes of the sea
For heaven's frost was weaving by the grave 
Displeased to think of heavenly praise
