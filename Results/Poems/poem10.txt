the body is a mosque borrowed from Heaven 	centuries of time

stain the glazed brick    our skin rubs away like a chip

in the middle of an hourglass    	sometimes I am so ashamed 


of my sentience how little it matters    	angels don't care about humility       

you shaved your head    	spent eleven days half-starved in solitary

and not a single divine trumpet wept into song  	now it's lonely all over 


I'm becoming more a vessel of memories than a person    	it's a myth

that love lives in the heart   	it lives in the throat we push it out

when we speak   	when we gasp we take a little for ourselves
