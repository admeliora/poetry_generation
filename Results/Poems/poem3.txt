The way the storm was closing into the strand of a dead old body. The brown sky is blurred and curled out to the fire again, the children of its doorways emanating a real light that we stream. Some would not reach her and the moon was driven off the cushioning and the pain of the buildings was like a radio in her glove, the scrape of a dog.

A girl cleansed in a parking lot, and the skin coiled in flowers and ash, a bright shoulder, a knife, and the sound of the sun and the sky like a pink window, a great party, and a small boy who lives in the back of his eyes.
