Someone will    	love you 	many will  	love
you     	many will brother you   some of these
loves will    	bother you   some   will  	leave you
one might    	haunt   you  	hunt you in your
sleep    	make you   	weep the tearless kind of
weep the     	kind of weep   that drowns your
organs 	slowly	there are little oars  in your body     
little boats   grab onto them and row and    	row
