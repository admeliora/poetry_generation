my grief in a box

if a blackened hand
doesn't shake slightly

as I check the gray
margins of design
and the trees outside

**

the soft plateaus
appropriate to converge

bodiless a flash of memory
plucked from outside 
before it was 

eager and beautiful

I stood there
and the cardboard light flowed
and the butter did not sing
I feel like drowning
suits too long in a scent of rain
see one bullet blinking with birds
with sockets of guilt,
we would have been the first
to arrive
