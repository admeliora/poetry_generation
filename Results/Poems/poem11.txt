For on the burning chamber-hills 
The beach threw down the moonlight in fear. 
But Love struck me on the silent morning's side, 
While she returns again the mighty fate,
The little mother said, "O my word! This always I did die, 
I never will not soften myself; 
Love is poor lore. Welcome again, my love, thou shouldst afford 
Our old one light at night behind." 
I saw the long green sky, 
While from the sandy mingled brook 
A sacred westward brim of blue-eyed flame
Â Under the cloud's delighted head; 
And blossom'd through the lightning water, 
With tender furies falling by 
As to thy verdant earth comes drown'd with light, 
Light small and black in sleep, under the starry stream 
And light the world that would be obscure, 
That the blessed ones should have this boon; 
Yet the sun's verse is weak and proud
